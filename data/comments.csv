Still super excited though.  I remember there was a post-apocalyptic timeline (not sure what caused it) and the main guy's future self is sort of a bad guy maybe probably.  Hopefully that's enough to get by.",scifi

53,"It may not be indicative of the highest caliber but I don’t think it should be called a “low bar” for writing, at least not insofar as low bar is an insulting term. Show, not tell, is easier said than done. I think most writers struggle with it and only a few are truly excellent. There is a lot of enjoyable fiction out there that may not make the “excellent” class but shouldn’t be insulted for it. 

Also, noticing good points of storytelling technique is not necessarily indicative of a sad state of tv writing. A lot of people who appreciate good storytelling and who come to talk about these things online are “trained” to notice what maybe most viewers don’t. I’ve noticed a lot of people online can identify these things. I actually spent time in basic story classes that pointed out these techniques. Just because I can point it out doesn’t mean that they did it poorly.

I say this while agreeing with you about the state of tv and film writing in general. For me though, it seems more like a lot scripts fee more like “first drafts” that just went straight to filming. :/  This show isn’t the best of sci-fi or tv, but it certainly wasn’t THAT for me either.",scifi

I agree some of the things are pretty far fetched but keeping in mind this in the mid-2030s and allowing for technologies to mature help with the suspension of disbelief.

I find their cell phone tech much more far fetched, having what seems like embedded projectors and sensors in their fingers somehow giving nearly opaque high def video and wireless communication abilities with ""touch"" sensors. Perhaps this tech allows for some limited interactions in VR as well.",scifi
72,"There are many, many, things wrong with the series, but these two are not that bad:

&gt; They can digitize a human consciousness, but people still use VR glasses to interact 

Well, the digitization process is destructive, one-way, and will nullify all your human rights. Still want to do it? VR / full immersion is a valid interaction mechanic given the maluses of the scanning process.

&gt; They have completely perfect, accident-free self driving cars, but require low paid workers for tech support?

Keep in mind this is for Lakeview, a posh, high-end environment for millionaires and billionaires. It's the difference between picking up the phone in a hotel and saying ""Wake me up at 7 in the morning"" vs fiddling with the alarm mode on the same phone. Some people need their butlers. And the AI is shown to not be  completely up to the task...

Some of my criticisms:

* These CS Reps have waaay too much time on their hands. you could argue that the subjective angel latency is a trackable metric, but still...
* Who in their right mind puts a suicide jump point in the system, in the simulation itself, in a place that is accessible to avatars? I mean, each person jumping off is a potentially infinite loss to the company.
* Nobody uses these really awesome AR/VR systems to telecommute? Latency's not an issue, apparently, as you can join from seedy little corner shops from locales with single-digit dollar-per-square-foot locales.
* I don't believe any billionaire worth the name would consent to such an existence without having a mongol army of lawyers making sure he still has his rights after the upload, security of mind and privacy being the major ones. Best way to do this? Make them law, which would apply for everyone.
* There are no buttons for 30 minute orgasms? Dude, you have the whole brain in emulation, and sex is shown to work. No guilt-free psychedelic trips? No brain overclocks? 
* No furries? Maybe it's just the conservative Lakeview, but these are the folks with both means and motive to engage in kinky shit. Likewise, no AI call girls? They don't need to do much...

Anyway, I could go on and on... I liked the show, but it suffers from the Star Trek technology of the week syndrome: tech is introduced but is never fully explored.",scifi
73,"David Weber has a couple of series.  Honor Harrington is his military sci-fi series, and the so called ""Honorverse"" is around 25 novels in the main series with quite a few spin-offs.   


He also has a series called Safehold which has the basic concept of humanity hiding from a superior race trying to kill them by reverting their technology to middle age-era.  That one is very interesting also, but suffer the same flaw as Honor Harrington: later books spent a lot of time setting up the world but the plot doesn't move forward much.  But that series details technology that already exists in great detail, so it's interesting for that.   


Another common theme of David Weber (author of both) is that he is a history buff. a LOT of characters are based off real life historical figures.  Sometimes he even makes puns off the name, for instance a major villain is named ""Rob S. Pierre"", which is a pretty obvious pun off a certain French dude.",scifi

Along the lines of Vorkosigan and *Old Man's War*, try Elizabeth Bear's *Vatta's War* or the Serrano Legacy.

Also humorous are Martha Wells' Murderbot books, starting with *All Systems Red*

For that cyberpunk feel, try *Altered Carbon* by Richard Morgan.

Also highly recommended are Becky Chambers (*A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet*) and Ann Leckie (*Ancillary Justice*)",scifi
97,"Clouds are formed when water condenses around tiny particles suspended in the air. As long as air circulates in the atmosphere and there are condensation nuclei and some water vapor in it, clouds will form regardless of the force of gravity. On Earth, different types of clouds form at different altitudes depending on the density and temperature of air. In a planet with a stronger gravity, the atmosphere will be compressed, so maybe clouds will tend to form at lower altitudes. If the winds are strong they might be able to carry moisture up to the highest reaches of the atmosphere so that the clouds will form there.

There are clouds on Jupiter. Clouds have been hypothesized on gigantic exoplanets. If there is a circulating fluid and drops of other fluid can be suspended in it, there will be clouds.",scifi

109,"Yeah, I see where you're coming from. I just couldn't root for the protagonists, so not my fav kind of show.",scifi
110,"I find Upload to be a very mediocre offering.  It has three main issues:

1. The class-warfare political message is as oppressive as it is boring.  I am SO SICK AND TIRED of the bad guy being some big bad corporation motivated by greed.  It doesn't matter if you think that is the shape of the world or not (it isn't)... at this point it's beyond cliche, beyond predictable... every second talking about the class divide between those who can upload and those who can't afford to is a waste of the viewer's time... Upload in this world is a SERVICE... just like every other service it WILL COST MONEY!  That shouldn't even have to be specified, it can be assumed that any viewer would be able to figure that out on their own the same way that they know that all clothes and food used by the characters is paid for... A defacto class divide between some uploads and other uploads, or those who can afford to upload and those who can't, might be diverting enough to be a minor theme in one episode, but it certainly does not support being belaboured to the point of being an entire multi-episode spanning plot!  It's like adding characters and a plot to a basic high school class on economics, and then calling it 'injustice' that 2+2=4 despite the fact that it would be convenient for it to equal 7.

2. The story does not take advantage of it's science fiction nature or themes.  It doesn't push the envelope of what could be done with a story with both virtual and non virtual characters.  If you wanted to play the class-warfare card then, there are way better ways to do it that the dumb portrayal of the 2gigs in Upload... you could have different run-speeds like the slow clubs in Permutation City.  Or if you want to say that complex thought somehow costs more, then have the 2gigs shift suddenly, and with no intermediate, between emotional states... they are HAPPY, or SAD, or ANGRY, but complex emotions like frustration, envy, melancholy are costly to simulate so they oscillate between emotional primary colors.  Similarly, there are no COPIES of uploaded people... you would think that backup copies, to say nothing of multiple instances of the same person running simultaneously would be a not just a thing, but a great way to explore stories that weren't just more of the narrative same.  It would be awesome to see the girlfriend character just rebooting her boyfriend after a social gaff from a state before it happened, or trying 15 different versions of the same conversation until she found one that worked the way she wanted.  One of the main story lines involves a love triangle between an upload and two flesh and blood women... well why can't they both have a copy of him?  The complete lack of willingness to explore what would make uploaded people DIFFERENT from normal people makes the story rather bland.  We see people altering the physical appearance of the upload's avatars... and hear about features such as double jointed hips being added... but where are the mental modifications?  Wouldn't it be interesting to include a capacity for an upload to turn on or off his sex drive?  or make himself smarter?  or add skills and knowledge with the press of a virtual button?  These and a dozen other obvious opportunities for really exploring a very different state of being are completely ignored.

3. The characters are very strangely written.  They go from being shallow to the point of not even being 2 dimensional to being deep and insightful on the drop of a hat.  One moment they are callous and dismissive, and the next considerate and sacrificing.  Sex is just dropped in with no point or purpose as if the authors had a tawdry check-list of sexual themes that must be met each episode.  I don't have a problem with sex in a story, but it should serve a function beyond window dressing about the hook-up culture of the future.  Just everything about how the story is written is inconsistent.",scifi
111,"Honor Harrington goes very very in-depth on how all the different weapons and other ship systems work. 

The ship battles are mostly tactical overviews “the first Manticore volley fired 1,254 missiles, 538 got intercepted, 300 detonated against the wedges, and the rest killed X number of ships” sort of thing

He also goes very in depth with the politics in the universe. 

In fact, these issues are a problem in the later novels, as the plot slows down to a crawl and most of the novels are simply fleshing out even more politics and stuff",scifi

I haven’t worked at McDonalds since they switched to full time breakfast but I can’t imagine how they did it. When I worked there were only 2 grills which needed to be full time on hamburger patties to keep up during peak demand. To do breakfast, you’d need one of them on breakfast full time which cuts production. Same with the assembly table, at full demand you need 2 tables doing lunch and there wouldn’t have been space to do breakfast as well. This doesn’t even take into account that you keep low demand items in the heating cabinets very long or they go bad so you’d either have to make all breakfast items to order (which requires more grill space which is already stretched) or just keeping food in the heating cabinet for way too long.

The customer service side is also broken to the point where it makes the show unwatchable for me. So one Angel has multiple Uploads to watch over, yet the office closes overnight? I worked tech for a major company for years, WE NEVER CLOSED. Night staffing was minimal compared to day staffing but the office was always occupied. Are Uploads afforded ANY privacy for their info or lives in the simulation? Also, bringing a hook-up in to a non customer facing office and then letting them wander around on their own, super not cool.

The biggest issue is the fact that Uploads aren’t confirmed to have human rights like people. This is pretty crucial to major story points in the show.

It was unlike anything Star Trek had ever accustomed me to.

That being said, having rewatched both shows... DS9 has aged way more gracefully than B5. Part of it is the effects: DS9 continued to rely on models, which aged better than B5's early CGI, which was groundbreaking at the time but *really* shows its age today. (Doesn't help that they lost the original models so textures look all muddy now.) But additionally, some of the acting on B5 is... iffy. As much as I loved them back in the day, Sheridan and Ivanova are rough to watch in spots. It was a very uneven ride.

197,"&gt; If you refer to McCoy and Spock smacktalking each other... they were friends, and this was how they talked to each other. You not approving of their way of friendship doesn't make it racist.

Whatever their friendship, that kind of conversation would lead to instant warnings or even termination today in far less formal settings. In the last 25 years I've not worked in any workplace where that kind of behaviour would have been considered acceptable.

It's also not at all only McCoy and Spock, but permeates the show.

**At the time** of TOS it was a progressive way of dealing with it, because it allowed them to address the racist views and make fun of them in a relatively non-threatening way without stepping over the boundaries *of the time*, but it does still make those racist views part of the story.

&gt; Serious lack of diversity?

How many women were in leading roles on the Enterprise? How many gay characters do you count? How many black people act as more than a glorified intercom?

Star Trek was a step forward, but it was a step forward for a deeply racist, homophobic and misogynistic society.

There's a reason TNG is already more inclusive. But TNG too is deeply dated in this respect.

This is part of what I mean by saying the Federation is a mirror, while the world the visits is what shows the future: To the extent there is diversity in TOS and TNG it is in the worlds they visit. Not all of them are positive, but those worlds are allowed to be *different* in a way the studio never allowed Star Fleet to be.

&gt; Stereotyped aliens all the time?

Try to count the number of times aliens are referred to by species to evoke their expected personality traits rather than describe their personality. Now consider if you replace all those mentions with ""black"" or ""asians"" or ""jews"" what it'd sound like and if you'd dared have all of those conversations in public today.

&gt; I'm watching TOS right now, and for the first time. I really don't see how you can say this. 

By watching it and actually paying attention. It's blatant and in your face to the point of being uncomfortable at times.

&gt; Roddenberry actually made an effort to portray the future, and not people in fancy dresses making contemporary remarks on todays times. You saying that this was ""never"" the case is a bit strong, if you ask me.

What he tried to do is one thing, but it was *never* the case on screen. His initial version of the Federation was dated within years, with it's total lack of openly gay characters, lack of more prominent black characters, lack of women in leading command positions etc., and regularly talking about people by referencing species/race rather than specific traits of an individual. TNG got better, but is still full of stereotyping. 

DS9 is more progressive than any of the ones that went before, but is still full of stereotyping.

I'm not saying they did bad when they were released - Star Trek has never been regressive at the time and has occasionally pushed the envelope. But it's pushed the envelope relative to present-day America, not relative to anything realistically futuristic.

In terms of social dynamics we're way past even DS9 in dealing with these issues already. Not very futuristic if they consistently fail to extrapolate even a couple of decades.

That's fine. They do more good by serving as mirrors to present day issues than presenting something that genuinely try to guess and extrapolate further into something people would have problems identifying with.

&gt; They couldn't pull off to integrate Ferengis as a honest and straight up different race. They were mostly handled like idiots by other races, especially by Klingons and Humans. The way the officers dealt with Quark was awful and sometimes downright criminal.

We'd only seen a handful of Ferengis at that point. The view of the Ferengis was shaped by stereotyping the handful shown. The Ferengi as they were existed as a species only because that assumed extrapolation was the inherent expectation of Star Trek at the time.

If it had not been, then nobody would have had an issue with suddenly seeing Ferengi's show up that are all different. 

But the Federation despite its high and mighty ideals, is in that incarnation full of racists who systematically talk about whole species of people as if they can be reduced to a stereotype of that species.

You can't change that overnight without totally changing the society around them to a point where it would no longer be recognisable Star Trek.

Dragging Trek forwards meant actually starting to show the stereotypes fail step by step by showing the characters themselves come to the realization that the Ferengi (and others) do not neatly fit the stereotypes.

At the same time it's clear the Ferenegi *does* have a deeply regressive culture, so some of the treatment where the treatment is about their culture is justified. 

But they're also given multiple arcs to show that individuals can transcend that culture and in turn start to change it, which knocks on its head the foundation of the early use of stereotypes in Star Trek as a ""shortcut"" to define characters. 

A lot of the character arcs in DS9 in fact focuses on showing how you can not assume someones character based on their species/race. 

Previously we had e.g. Spock and Worf presented as the ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" characters who struggle with their identity, and where as such their actions in contradiction of stereotype is treated as part of that conflict, and as such they're ""exceptions"". 

This view of the ""exception"" that has been ""tamed"" and taught our culture is in itself a deeply racist trope to many by modern standards. I have deeply racist white neighbours with black friends. Their black friends are all ""exceptions"" that as exceptions can not invalidate my neighbours racist stereotypes of black people because they're not ""like those others"" as they've told me more than once.

In DS9 instead we see characters that are unapologetically sure of their identity as part of their species *but still acts in ways that contradicts the stereotype* without some nod to being half human or brought up by humans etc. to make them exceptions.

That's the biggest legacy that DS9 left Trek with: You can no longer see any of these species and safely assume they'll act according to a stereotype unless they wear a Star Fleet uniform and have been ""tamed"".",scifi

&gt; and serious lack of diversity, and the way other species were treated as stereotypes defined by their behaviour all the time.

Serious lack of diversity? Stereotyped aliens all the time? I'm watching TOS right now, and for the first time. I really don't see how you can say this. This isn't even remotely true in my view. Quite the opposite. It's even better in that regard than todays SciFi, including STD and STP.


&gt; Federation society has never been ""the future"", but a mirror of whatever ""today"" the current series is made in.

Roddenberry actually made an effort to portray the future, and not people in fancy dresses making contemporary remarks on todays times. You saying that this was ""never"" the case is a bit strong, if you ask me.


&gt; Yes, they were. Because the starting point was that they were totally in the gutter. Total outcasts. They were presented like the scum of the universe back to their first appearance in TNG: Greedy, misogynistic, chauvinistic, untrustworthy.

That's true. The depiction in TNG was not very well made. I think the hate for capitalism from possibly Roddenberry was quite visible. This is one of the biggest complains I have on TNG.

You are right, DS9 made more out of the Ferengis than just evil and dumb capitalists. But if you ask me..... very little, and in ways that were really problematic. I do liked Quark as a child. But when I rewatched DS9 as an adult, this changed completely. Don't get me wrong. I still liked the dialogues, I still liked the dynamics between other characters and Quark. It was like all good TV shows - written in an interesting way. But it absolutely did not fit into the scheme of Star Trek for me.

217,"DS9 was made darker in some respect, but their treatment of racism was not it. 

On the contrary, if there's anything to fault it for in that respect it is that it does not go anywhere near the kind of darkness and lasting conflict real racism involves. 

Ben Sisko does some soul searching and accepts Nog. Miles does some soul searching and grudgingly learns to accept Cardassians. Sisko has issues with Vic Fontaine's whitewashing of history with its racism-free Vegas one moment, but accepts stereotyping by species in Ops the next moment (and throughout the series). And so on. Racism in DS9 is to be shrugged off and put aside, and everyone decides to live together happily ever after.

Their treatment of war was much darker, though that too sanitized it to an extreme extent. 

DS9 is an extremely idealized version of a somewhat more realistic future, and that makes it seem darker at times. But it's still idealized.

I also don't buy that it's all that much darker. TOS has Federation official turn a planet into nazis and prepare for genocide as a way to illustrate the need for non-interference, for example. It seems light hearted in large part down to the exchanges on the bridge - often full of racism - that downplay the misery they keep running into, and because the episodic format meant they always saved the day in the end to not leave things unresolved.

But they go from crisis after crisis showing us a universe full of war, slavery and oppression, and showing us that intervention often makes things worse or achieves nothing.

It's ""light"" with a childs eye that ignores the underlying misery. I wish I could see it that way.

DS9 to me is much more positive - it shows a society that is transforming and growing and learning. Cardassia goes from an oppressive dictatorship to civilian rule. Bajor comes out from under their foot and reasserts itself. The founders are beaten and taught a lesson. The Ferengis are on course to reform their whole society. Large parts of the alpha quadrant manages to come together and set aside their differences and cooperate. The story liftes two entire quadrants of the galaxy significantly up. There's dark moments, but they serve to punctuate a story that for the most part represents a massive upwards trajectory.",scifi
218,"I think the disappointment with GoT was particularly acute because a lot of people had convinced themselves that the weaknesses of S5+ were going to be redeemed with some kind of amazing payoff in the final season. 

With Lost, people figured out the mystery box BS by S3.",scifi
219,"No, it *was* untenable. TOS had the Federation characters making racist jibes to each other, even *on the bridge*, and serious lack of diversity, and the way other species were treated as stereotypes defined by their behaviour *all the time*.

By the time of DS9 trying to pretend to a new audience that the federation was some sort of bigotry free ideal of purity haven would have been a total joke, because it was so damn obvious it was not. 

It was  tolerable because we knew that ""out of universe"" these series still represented a step forward for their era, but that only remained the case because each new series actually changed to reflect changing sensibilities - Federation society has never been ""the future"", but a mirror of whatever ""today"" the current series is made in. 

The possible futures for humanity have always been the new worlds they visited, not the Federation itself.

All DS9 did in that respect was admit and deal with it instead of trying to shuffle the racism under the carpet and pretend it didn't exist. That in itself was a mirror of increasing openness around discussion of racial issues in society at the time.

&gt; I don't think they displayed the Ferengi in any serious way.

While there's certainly an element of them as ""gag suppliers"", Nog was used repeatedly to address racism in quite serious ways; Rom and Moogie (and to a lesser extent Quark) were used to address gender equality. They got the most extensive treatment of family dynamics on the show; even more so than Ben/Jake Sisko and the Miles's.

&gt; He felt like Ferengi were some kind of second class citizens in the show.

Yes, they were. Because the starting point was that they were totally in the gutter. Total outcasts. They were presented like the scum of the universe back to their first appearance in TNG: Greedy, misogynistic, chauvinistic, untrustworthy. Of course they were second class.

What changed in DS9 is that they went from being pure stereotypes to being treated as individuals, and some of them were lifted up massively during the run of the series.",scifi

But it probably depends on the setting.

In this case, the stories in WH40K are set in ""our"" far future, which more or less plops it into ""proper"" science fiction.

But at the same time, similar to *Star Wars* and *Barbarella*, they don't really make much of an attempt to describe how all of the sciency stuff is sort of supposed to work, in principle; apart from vague hand-waving about superb gene-engineering and machine spirits.

I always thought of Space Opera as being closer to fantasy, in space, than science fiction that's halfway plausible. i.e. the story and adventure are much more important than how this servitor's is screaming silently inside his skull for centuries because the techpriest failed to invoke the litany of the empty mind during the servitorization process :-)

Also, everything must be COLOSSAL. The bigger the better. Especially if it explodes.

It's also vitally important for the characers' pauldrons and starched collars to occlude their peripheral vision.

On the other hand, WH40K handles ""magic"" quite nicely, by making it a manifestion of a different strata of reality, i.e. the Warp and its infinite energy being chanelled through some poor bastard's burning eyeballs; instead of simply being benign magic that doesn't try to kill the user that often. Even the ""gods"" are simply COLOSSAL aliens, of a sort.

There's nothing wrong with space opera, it's fun :-)",scifi

Besides the overreliance on technobable to save the day at the end of almost every episode instead of just being a tool to move the plot along, most of the characters are kind of flat and I find myself not being all that invested in any of them most of the time.

379,"The transformation of the Ferengi is notably one of the most obvious ways in which DS9 was the first Trek that openly addressed racism in the Federation instead of as ""look at that backwards racist culture; we'd never do that"" of TOS.

TOS openly used racial stereotypes to address racism one moment, while having e.g. McCoy constantly using racial jibes against Spock, for example (not to mention the ethnic makeup of the crew etc.). TNG and Voyager got marginally better.

But DS9 goes all in from early on: Sisko was confronted about his racist stereotyping of Nog when Jake first befriends him for example.

But the Ferengi definitively benefited from that choices to actually try to reduce the treatment of the other species to racial stereotypes most of all, with Nog showing they can succeed in Star Fleet, Rom going from stereotypical Ferengi chauvinist to accepting females as equal and standing up from workers rights, Moogie showing Ferengi women as strong and capable, and even Quark showing a sympathetic side on a semi-regular occasion.

It was basically the first Trek that effectively openly admitted to be a mirror of contemporary American society rather than to striving to actually depict the future, and as such they could admit to there being racism and stereotyping and address them explicitly by having recurring characters - including Benjamin and Miles - struggle with their own views, instead of trying to pretend the Federation itself was pure, which had become increasingly untenable.",scifi

430,God I heard that in Rom's voice,scifi
431,"When the Defiant shows up in season 3 the show gets better.  They tried to make up for the lack of a starship early on by having the larger runabouts instead of shuttlecraft, but it was hard to make them appear capable against pretty much anything else.  The Defiant was a legitimate *warship* which really allowed DS9 to project some influence.  

Early on the show also feels pretty standard to the Trek formula.  Episodes were standalone with the continuity being somewhat rare and confined to more of a background role.  In my opinion, when The Dominion shows up and starts a war the show went from good to incredible and is also when the long-form continuity started to express itself.  There was a storyline at the beginning of a season (5 or 6? Can't remember precisely) that was essentially a 6 or 7 episode mini-series following a military campaign with Sisko as one of the chief strategists.  It was an incredible story arc that had several epic space battles and was unlike anything a Star Trek had ever done.

The show just took a bit to find its groove, but once it did everything changes.  Push through the first two seasons and you *will* be rewarded.

Also, give Enterprise a shot.  Season one was very standard Trek and wasn't bad.  Granted, season two was unfortunately some of the worst content in the ST franchise and felt cliche and unoriginal, but gets better.  Season 3 was, IMHO, was absolutely grand with some serious long-form continuity following a year long mission in the Xindi Expanse.  It set the stage for many future Star Trek tropes and concepts.  The final season is when the show really found its legs with a solid compromise with serialization.  They did several 2 to 3 episode arcs that let them tell traditional Trek storylines but with enough time to really flesh out the ideas.

Enterprise is a controversial show for a lot of Trekkies, but personally I really liked *most* of it.",scifi
432,"I’m about to finish my fourth rewatch of DS9, with no desire to rewatch TNG, oddly. Whenever I see how dated next gen always seems, it pulls me out of the story. I think for me anyways, it’s because those characters never went away. I loved watching Picard, for example, but it just highlights that that story, and those characters have continued to evolve and expand, whereas the old stories seem so limited in retrospect. And it’s not just DS9, I’ve been through Voyager several times, and even Enterprise more than twice. 

Don’t get me wrong, I *loved* TNG back in the day. And I still love those characters and those actors. But (like TOS) it’s just not held up to rewatchability for me.",scifi

So if that's true then when the big bang created equal amounts of matter and antimatter they went in different directions along the time dimension.  To get to that other universe, which isn't parallel to ours, you'd have to time travel farther back in time than the big bang.  So if the theory is true it couldn't help you time travel because you'd already need to be able to time travel just to get to the other universe.

This would be some od the best writing in this particular niche. (The outlier here is Market Forces, which I couldn't quite connect to and was a DNF for me.)

Also, The Sparrow by Mary Doria Rusell is one of the best novels I ever read. Not just genre, but in general.    The synopsys may sound errr unappealing - Jesuits manage to fund and launch a flight to newly discovered exoplanet with intelligent life before anyone else. However, it comes with an incredible plot and characters and the author came up with a superb way to tell the story.

But these are very superficial adaptations.  Things like vertebrae evolved 500 million years ago, but this basic structure evolved only once. It isn't necessarily the best solution; not the most efficient solution. But it worked. For nature to start over with a new approach, a mass extinction would need to wipe out all vertebrates.

How it ended doesn't change that. The ending itself just made it infamous, mere salty redditors can't push a joke petition for a S8 remake to 1.8M signatures. The ending was rightly hated by a huge part of the audience and the entire cultural impact of the show ended in an instant. Can you see any GoT hype right now? Everyone just forgot it, because at the end it sucked so bad it made you unable to rewatch the show without turning off the first episode 5 minutes in.

That last season was just the cherry on top the crap-cake that were S5-8. In S5-6 half the storylines were botched, by S7 it was all dumb plots and action emphasis. Action scenes were shot well and technical execution, music and acting were top notch. But the writing has been taking a deep dive since S5 onward. It went from a 9.5/10 show for 4 seasons to a 6/10 show at best for s5-7 and a 0/10 for S8.

Lost, by comparison, was a different show. It was clear to me from like halfway into season 2 they were just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. It had several great executed moments, but they were never a part of something constantly well-written and high-level, as GoT was for half its run. It never had an intricately crafted overall story to follow.

Things were introduced and underwhelmingly moved aside or abruptly dropped all the time there. Well, not all the time, but plenty of times to make an impression, and it always relied on the mystery box approach to keep you invested.

It was always parts of some plotlines that were decent and exciting - the rest of the time it was a wheel-spinning mess, flashback/sideways-ing with minor characters that rarely contributed much, and chasing something that never amounted to anything more than fucking purgatory. The mystery box with nothing inside.

At this point I'm so fucking pissed at the way D&amp;D handled it, I'm done forever. If I ever rewatch it I'll stop at S4 but I have literally negative desire to do so even now.

My first instinct would be to say GoT, that ending was one of the worst I've ever seen. But then I have to wonder if I'm only choosing GoT cause it's still ""fresh"" while Lost is old news. 

I think I'm gonna go with GoT. Lost was bad, I'll never believe they had a plan. But they also didn't just stab it in the back to get it over with, unlike GoT. I feel like GoT was sabotaged, internationally or otherwise. 

Also Lost wasn't all that great either, while the first season had promise, I feel like subsequent seasons didn't fully live up to that promise. I'd say the quality of the last season wasn't that much lower than the quality of the first season.

GoT on the other hand started out strong and stayed strong for years. It was only the last couple seasons or so where quality started to take a dive, then the last season just went full retard.

588,Probably would have if they'd have followed the book - it was a much better dystopia,scifi
589,"It's completely different in tone, plot, themes, and characters other than the name of the protagonist and the concept of deadly gameshows.

The book is an indictment of corporate societies; it shows a dystopian future where everything has been deregulated so much that corporations have complete control, and workers have no rights. Corporations have complete control over the government, which is only used to implement corporation-friendly rules. Example: every household must have a TV in it, and you can't turn it off to hide the ads, you can only turn the volume down to an extent.

The protagonist is an out of luck mechanic who's been unemployed for years following refusing to work in unsafe conditions. His only way to make money is to enter the games ""willingly"" - willingly is in brackets there, because he does so of his own volition, and signs all the waivers and such.

The theme can't be mistaken - it's as subtle as a sledgehammer. The protagonist rage-chucks a book that promotes ""pull yourself by the bootstraps"" optimism, kidnaps and gives a reality-check to a naive middle-class person who thinks the poor are poor because they want to be, etc...

The movie? Standard action-hero nonsense where the hero is a government operative turning against the government when ordered to shoot civilians, succesfully leads resistance.

620,"&gt; the fact remains that Carbon is one of the most versatile elements in the creation of life-supporting compounds

Yeah, silicon gets bandied about a lot because it has the same valence structure as carbon but that's extremely unlikely imo once you look at the actual geometry of the molecules. Silicon is a fat little element whereas carbon can form an incredibly diverse set of molecules due to the bond geometries. I very much think there may be non-chemical life somewhere in the universe of a form that may be utterly unrecognizable to us, but the vast, VAST majority will be carbon based.


&gt; Bacteria will. Bacteria don’t require a host to be compatible in cell structure or DNA...they just require the host to be organic

I was thinking this as well. Probably most places with alien life, where that life is single-celled extremophile bacteria analogs, we'd be fine. But if we did find earth-like planets - planets with similar temp ranges, liquid water, and breathable atmosphere - there will be bacteria analogs that find the inside of our bodies to be a nice place to live.",scifi

There’s no reason to believe that a being in this universe would have formed via another set of physical laws, therefore it’s highly likely that any life in the universe is carbon-based, with a similar cell-tissue-organ construction. The differences will be evolutionary...they may not be bipedal, they may not resemble anything on Earth’s surface at all. But the major underpinnings will be similar. 

Viruses probably won’t be the issue. Bacteria will. Bacteria don’t require a host to be compatible in cell structure or DNA...they just require the host to be organic.",scifi
623,"One of my favorite versions of interstellar plague comes from the Revelation Space universe. It's basically an infectious nano-plague that only effects machines and augmented humans. Technology is still very advanced and many humans augment anyway but it's a good plot device to indicate why the human race hasn't become effectively immortal - most dont augment themselves with the tech required because it would leave them open to infection by the melding plague.

I wonder if these biological differences would mean we couldn't meaningfully digest alien flora and fauna even. Based on abiogenesis experiments on Earth, I think a lot of alien life (not all but a lot) would still use amino acids and protein structures of a sort. Would be interested to hear more from someone with a biology background.",scifi

In it, our hero bypasses being a contestant on some of the ""Win or get maimed or both"" game shows, and applies for the big banana, which is closer to a nationwide reality show in which the bounty team that never fails is sent after you, you're responsible for filming video segments yourself and mailing them to the producers, and the rest of the country can get cash bonuses for informing on your location.

* *The Horn of Time*, Poul Anderson. Contains ""The Man Who Came Early"", about a modern man dropped into 10th century Iceland.
* The High Crusade, Poul Anderson
* any collection of short stories by Ray Bradbury
* Otherness: short stories by David Brin
* Martians, Go Home! by Fredric Brown
* A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess
* Treason, Orson Scott Card (can't stand his politics but he writes a good tale at times)
* The Tripods Trilogy, John Christoper (YA but holds up well)
* The World of Tiers, Philip Jose Farmer (first in a five-book series. The others are okay as action books, but not as good as the first IMO)
* Dragon's Egg, Robert L. Forward
* Forever War, Joe Haldeman
* Harry Harrison: Stainless Steel Rat series is fun; Make Room, Make Room; The Technicolor Time Machine; The Turing Option (with Marvin Minsky)
* Most Heinlein before about 1970 is pretty good, but as someone else said, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is one of his best.  Stay away from Farnham's Freehold; it's disgusting. Waldo, Double Star, Tunnel in the Sky, The Door into Summer, Orphans of the Sky, Job: A Comedy of Errors are good.
* Anne McCaffrey's Pern book are entertaining. Start with Dragonflight. Crystal Singer is good; the later books are okay, but not as good.
* A Canticle for Leibowitz, Walter M. Miller, Jr.
* I think Larry Niven is at his best in his short stories
* The Mote in God's Eye, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
* His Dark Materials, Phillip Pullman. 
* A Time of Changes; Lord Valentine's Castle. Robert Silverberg 
* Nearly anything by Charles Stross
* Steel Beach, John Varley. plus many other things, too. 
* Agent of Chaos, Norman Spinrad. Kinda hokey but fun.
* A Fire upon the Deep; Vernor Vinge
* books by Kurt Vonnegut, of course
* Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang, Kate Wilhelm
* Doomsday Book, Connie Willis
* The Day of the Triffids, John Wyndham

I love this movie, I seen it as a kid and it was so dark to me. I couldn’t get my head around a game show with real deaths. It was way ahead of its time.

Btw, obviously the book is much better. Just that some movies really make a huge impression on you in your youth when the world seems so innocent, and you come across movies like this.

805,"As far as foundational classics, I didn't see Robert A Heinlein mentioned. He's written some good hard sci-fi, but also some really kind of out there whackadoodle stuff. Starship Troopers and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress are both good. Stranger in a Strange Land starts getting a little more into some more oddball ideas.

For modern Sci-Fi writers, Neal Stephenson does an amazing job. As far as I have read, all of his stuff is standalone. It's typically within the Cyberpunk genre. Anathem is a wonderful novel about what I tend to describe as ""math monks."" Snow Crash is a lovely cyberpunk dystopian novel that pokes fun at its own genre. The Diamond Age, while a little dated feeling, shows a world with a focus on societal impacts of nanobots. I'm also part way through Fall; or Dodge in Hell. It's pretty Americentric, but the societal backdrop he paints in this one is that of a ""post-truth"" society - one in which 'facts' aren't actually universally agreed upon pieces of information and which 'fact' a person believes depends on which ""datafeed curation"" they subscribe to.",scifi

If you judge a human man by human woman beauty standards, 99.99999999% of them would be considered extremely unsexy with proportions that are all off and things are just not where they should be.

892,"Lets say their is a war, factories are targeted, riots ensue, national collapse, environmental disasters occur, fresh water is fought over, and billions are lost. In this scenario, technological collapse would be massive. Of course, this is a stretch since global collapse would have to take place, this would only be a science fiction related occurrence because we as humans haven’t faced such circumstances yet, and most likely wont for quite some time. 

But let’s say millions of years from now, and we have created colonies on the moon, mars, or an asteroid, and for some reason that colony is faced with national collapse, disease, natural disaster, or simply war, it will be harder and harder to destabilize the higher technology has advanced. Since these colonies are fairly isolated, the only way for them to avoid technological collapse would be to A) have separate communities to divide technology production to ensure infrastructural survival or B) rely on outside communities for technological imports and infrastructural aid.

There are examples of this occurring in history on a smaller scale, and could be repeated on a larger one if we face a great filter in the future. My favorite (albeit morbid)  is the Mayan collapse, disease came in just before spanish officials arrived in the capital, hundreds of thousands were already sick in outlying regions causing early urban collapse. By the time the spanish officials arrived and mingled with the capital, many more got sick, and due to the Mayan Lifestyle, disease spread quite quickly. Soon Mayan citizens attacked and killed a few spanish officals, causing the remaining parties to leave. The Mayan people got sicker, and sicker, the city faced famine, drought from lack of abled bodied workers, and was full of dead corpses. Those few who survived witnessed their world collapse, and many artisans who could make technologically advanced goods at the time were lost, many resulted self banishing to the wilderness and avoided the plagued city. The mayan culture never bounced back, but a few mayans did survive and remembered what happened.

If this is tl:dr, then I’ll put it simply, 

Civilization Collapse is quite possible and has occurred, it is harder to happen currently with multiple technologically advanced nations, but possible. 

Global Collapse could happen, but would need great filter-like circumstances to occur and is not suspected to happen in our life time currently.",scifi

**High Life (2018) I award 2/5 stars.**

My issue succinctly can be summed up by that there were 3 writers credited for the movie and it certainly felt that way while watching it. There were parts I loved and parts I hated and unfortunately it just felt like a jumbled mess. First warning to the wise, the movie is very different from the trailer. The trailer (to me) implied a character driven sci-fi thriller of people trapped aboard a derelict ship. In reality, the movie is very much a product of its famous director (who I was unaware of previously) and is largely a french new wave arthouse film set in space.

**WHAT I LOVED**

There are many things about the movie I did enjoy, though I admit I flopped back and forth a couple of times through-out the movie. For one, it feels and looks a lot of the time like a  70's era pulp sci-fi. The ship and costuming and science are very much the antithesis of hard sci-fi. At first this bothered me, I think because I'm used to more modern sci-fi, but as time went on I came back around to it. It was nostalgic without leaning on nostalgia.

What I was enjoying most about the movie was that it began *in media res*. The camera pans over a humid and wet garden set amongst rough-hewn steel in soft greens and blues. As the camera rotates it ends on a shot of a shoe sticking halfway out of the soft garden dirt before pulling out and behind the plastic curtains you encounter at supermarkets in the cold section. I was hooked. Excitedly, I prepared myself for the mystery of ""what happened here and what will these people do now?"" as the camera crawled around the interior of the ship, following the sounds of a chattering baby. We pass old brown blood stains on the wall, scrawled graffiti, and jumbled plastic bins left around haphazardly. Clearly there is a story here.

**WHAT I DID NOT LIKE**

Unfortunately what I didn't like can be summed up by one 2 minute scene that happened about 10-15 minutes after the beginning I've already described. We see a train passing through a bleak countryside. On the train is an older man and a younger woman. The woman is interviewing him and calls him professor. Professor then expositories about the people they've sent up into space and how there is no hope for them. End scene. These people are never shown or mentioned ever again. The scene's one purpose is the hold your hand and explain things that you were already beginning to pick up on. This continues throughout the movie. Much of the movie is implied and left up to the viewer to piece together, which I appreciate. Clues and hints are left in the characters, the set design, etc. AND YET, anytime someone opens their mouth they then talk to the viewer and explain everything which is immensely frustrating and annoying.

The way the characters were used also bothered me. On one hand, the movie DOES present a grim character study of what does it mean to be alone in space, in addition to not only being the usual type who goes to space because they choose to for some lofty goal, but rather that the people sent are the rejects of society. How do these band of criminals form their own society? Can they work together to move beyond their past and create a new future? What happens when a baby is born into this new world of theirs? How will she be affected as she grows older? Unfortunately, the movie drops the ball on this and doesn't pursue it to an end. Indeed, rather than allowing us into this world and picking up hints of the past while focusing on Robert Pattinson raising his daughter (which to me would have been the interesting portion), for the majority of the movie it's all flashbacks to before Willow (the baby) was born. Within these flashbacks are flashbacks to the convicts time on earth; I suppose with the intent of showing us that people are people and come from different lives? Largely, I felt this to be pointless. Show, don't tell.

**THE PLOT**

The plot was also jumbled. Half of it I loved, half of it I hated. The basic premise is that society has taken death row inmates and sent them into space to act as scientific guinea pigs. Not a new idea, but a valid and good one, worth exploring in new ways. For this particular mission, the primary goal is to explore fertility in space. The idea of generational ships is also not a new one, but the movie brings up the point that there is radiation in space. Can humans even procreate? THAT was new and interesting to me, but it doesn't explore that plot point either. Nor does it capitalize on what it means to be a child born into that society, as I previously mentioned. Indeed, the movie ends &gt;!|| by fast-forwarding past all the interesting parts of Willow's childhood to when she is a 16 year old girl who is surprisingly clever, well spoken, and well adjusted. Her and her father are now pursuing the conclusion of their mission with a random additional exploration of conducting experiments by shooting themselves into a black hole. The same experiment we saw briefly earlier in the movie that killed her mother. Credits roll as they move forward into the black hole.||!&lt;

**CONCLUSION**

I gave the movie two stars because I am very disappointed. I felt there were many interesting threads and scenes and pieces in the movie that could have been explored, but instead the movie picked up all these different parts, played with them briefly, and then set them back down again to move on to something else. There was no clarity to the movie and it was largely a jumbled mess.

HOWEVER, I am clearly reviewing the movie and judging it from a perspective of a sci-fi/thriller/drama. I have no experience with French New Wave Arthouse and can not judge it on that merit. Perhaps it succeeds in that regard. I will say however that I saw the movie with my girlfriend who is more experienced in that genre than I and she wasn't a fan of the movie either. There is one interesting scene in the movie to that end that did cause me to think: &gt;!||We see one of the prisoners attempting to rape one of the women before he is caught and killed by the other prisoners. The movie clearly presents this as bad and evil. However, in the next scene we see the female doctor raping Robert Pattinson. The scene is filmed sensuously with soft light and sweet music playing. Viscerally, we are supposed to view this as a love scene, however it is clearly rape as Pattinson has been drugged into sleep. Coming on the heels of the prior scene, it felt intentional. I assume the director was asking us to explore how society views rape on women vs men, but as the rest of the movie is so jumbled, I'm cautious to ascribe intent to what may have been accidental.||!&lt;",scifi

It seems more and more sci-fi is going down this dark and gritty path.  The only times it's actually worked is in Idiocracy and Wall-E, and those films both have a balance between colour and grit, and aren't sci-fi films either.  (I didn't mention Blade Runner because I wanted to stick to 21st century films - and because Blade Runner was going for a distinct film noir vibe.)

This was a great idea, over-saturated  by bland boring worldbuilding whose only thing holding it up is ''the good guys are evil in this universe.'' That is wrong and dumb. Star Trek's mirror universe stands out as a good Mirror Universe as a whole because of how it exists as a whole. Cochrane shoots Vulcans and humanity becomes a Gay Pride March in the style of Warhammer 40K. Klingons and other races fight against humanity.

My main complaint about them is that it created more problems than solutions. In my eyes, mirror universes are hit or miss, to the point there is one so bad that I refuse to watch the episode about it because of the reason said universe existed is because of the Reflection Cave. I am not joking. It's existence was based on something that connects Shalour City and Route 11. It was there to add filler that is pointless, unnecessary, bland and trash in my eyes and an outright insult to the Pokemon franchise.

The Mirror World is a useless world that deserves to share the same fate as  Typhon Primaris from Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 2.

Also, the Magog were interesting - an intelligent species deliberately created to be able to live only on fresh meat that they killed themselves, and able to reproduce only by injecting their eggs into a sapient host (who does not survive the process). Some very few of them abhor their own nature and stick to eating fish and animals, but they constantly suffer pangs of hunger because it's not quite sufficient.",scifi
1158,"From dictionary.com
Masterpiece: noun
1. A person’s greatest piece of work, as in an art;
2. Anything done with masterly skill;
3. A consummate example of skill or excellence of any kind;
4. A piece made by a person aspiring to the rank of Master in a guild or other craft organization as proof of competence.

3. Lost in Space - fun and visually fantastic. The family squabbles and Dr Smith can be a wee irritating here and there but it doesn’t ruin the fun of it 

4. You could try Farscape again. I found a skip it watch it list which was helpful. I am almost through season 3.  The first half of season 1 and then the first half of season 2 were iffy but the rest has been pretty good.

Definitions can change but I’d say this is like arguing 3rd world to mean a developing country when in actuality it means an unaligned country in the Cold War. The definition is included in the dictionary now, but it’s still wrong. You could replace force with magic, laser swords with swords, and spaceships with boats and it’d leave the story untouched.

1242,"Huh? You are arbitrarily deciding that sci-fi = you think it is based on science, but you aren't citing to anyone who agrees. You are just stating it. Which is fine if that's important to you but, my point is that a lot of sci-fi is not based on science at all. Actually, almost nothing in sci-fi is rooted in science. The vast majority of sci-fi is just a made up technology that is used as a mcguffin to drive the plot.

But the best sci-fi almost always uses a made up universe to make a point.

Star Trek has absolutely nothing to do with science. It is 100% about morality in a utopian future where we have moved past economic want... through technology that could easily be magic (but it's more optimistic if the magic is something we made so, Roddenberry used tech). 

The Matrix has nothing to do with science either. It's basically the gnostic philosophy restated through VR while set in a dystopian future that was drawn heavily from Gibson's Neuromancer -- which itself was not science, but a reflection of the dystopian world Gibson says he saw all around him.

Battlestar Galactica is completely noir tackling modern politics episode to episode in another part of the Galaxy. There's no ""science"" in that show either.

Star Wars is the classic Messiah/fairy tale journey blended with influences from WWII movies and spaghetti Westerns. Nothing in it is science. But all of the set pieces are the exact same things you see throughout sci-fi.

That's why bookstores/Amazon/etc. sell Star Wars in the sci-fi aisle, and Disney spends millions marketing it alongside other sci-fi offerings. You can say you disagree with that characterization, which is fine if that matters to you. I just pointed out that arguing over whether it is sci-fi (which is what the creators call it) or fantasy (what you call it), doesn't really matter to me as much as ""is it any good?""",scifi

Cricton's thing is that he writes a story about scientists investigating or inventing something, it goes horribly wrong, therefore science bad.

It's the same as unbrainwashing someone by convincing them they're brainwashed. He's trying to control the machine interfaced to his brain - of course the ability to do so will be significant.

- Jurassic Park, when Dr. Saddler counsels John Hammond about his failing park “But you can’t think through this one John you have to feel it.”

- In the Matrix when Morpheus says of Neo “he’s beginning to believe!” 

- Signs, when god apparently directs extraterrestrials to abduct humans who are 70% water, which is toxic/corrosive to them. 

- Interstellar, when Matthew McConnoughy travels through spacetime to save humanity from blight with the power of love. 

-Gravity, where Sandra Bullock survives orbital reentry  thanks to the ghost of George Clooney’s grief counseling.

That being said it’s still pretty good. Very similar to the Star Trek episodic style with a decent overarching plot. It was originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry after all. I get the sense that there was a definite plan for the entire story from the get go but it feels like the show may have fallen prey to producers wanting/making changes based on ratings/money. 

As others have said, Stargate is pretty fantastic if you want a version of Star Trek that’s just a little bit more military focused. Still plenty of idealism and exploration of classic sci-fi tropes and concepts, just a little more action. 

Lexx. It’s strange. Like really strange. First season is great on its own as it’s four 90min episodes. Season two follows pretty clearly after that and has a standard American length season(for a 90s show). Season three moves in a different direction, still interesting if you’ve gone through the first two seasons so why not keep going. And the season 4. Wow season 4. There is some amazing satire about America in season 4 but again it stays away from the style and feel of its previous seasons. Also if you do watch Lexx, be prepared for a LOT of sexual innuendo. 

1995 outer limits is great for an anthology series

And for one final recommendation. This is one is probably the farthest from “sci-fi” and more in line with any other sitcom. But I truly love 3rd Rock From the Sun. It follows aliens disguised as a non traditional human family trying to understand the human condition. Again it’s hardly what I would call sci-fi but the writing is great and Jon Lithgow has some of the best comedic timing.",scifi

Based on YOUR definition:

Prequels: Two large political factions pit robot (droid) armies vs clone armies in a broad scale interstellar war.  

OG Trilogy: An interstellar empire constructs a giant laser to destroy planets with the aim of using it as a means of interplanetary control.

Sequel Trilogy: A remnant of the above interstellar empire builds a weapon that accelerates energy beyond the speed of light to destroy planets in a revisit of the above plot.

These all provide significant background for major plot points such that the entire thing would have to be reworked if any one of them changed.

1320,"Love Babylon 5 and the 3 90s Star Trek shows! I agree it's super hard to scratch that itch, though.

Stargate is fun. It can be a little slow, and can be a little campy at times... but I feel like it fits in with some of the Star Trek pacing. Also I kinda feel like some of the inter-personal dynamics can have a B5 feel at times, in a 90s sort of way (like Sinclair's relationships/command styles with his senior officers, etc). They are in basically present time, though, but so much is off planet and even though the humans don't have sci fi tech and stuff really at first, I love the way it slowly gets integrated as they learn more about the way the galaxy and alien species work. Also the over-arching plots are *nowhere* near as interesting or compelling as B5, but honestly are there any show that match B5? 

The Expanse has a lot going for it, and it is a well written show - coming from a book probably helps - but the scale and pacing is pretty different from B5. If you haven't watched, it's worth a shot. I liked seasons 2 and 3 best by far - Season 1 didn't do a ton for me. 

Otherwise, yeah, I honestly feel like there just aren't a ton of great, epic-scale, well done space sci-fi shows out there, and it makes me sad. Even the ""good"" ones feel like they're often missing something.

The new Lost in Space was better than I expected, which isn't saying much. It's not *mind blowing...* I kinda think of it like the 100. Not amazing, but can be fine when I want some sci fi and don't have anything else.  

If you don't mind anime and animated stuff, there might be some great stories worth exploring there that could scratch that itch. 

Also, just to float it - some awesome books that hit on the epic scale, aliens, spaceships stuff, too. I just finished Becky Chambers' trilogy, starting with The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, and it was super fun and pretty easy to get into.",scifi

But from a story perspective, saying ""this all happens in another galaxy from a long time ago, where the rules are completely different"" or ""this all happens in the future where technology is so fantastical that it looks like magic"" is like separating your preservatives into jams and jellies. Is there a difference? Possibly. But... does it matter?

For instance, should fictional stories involving psychics be considered sci-fi? There's absolutely nothing scientific about psychic powers and no scientist would seriously suggest there is. Likewise, FTL literally breaks the laws of physics, rather than building off them. Yet, we all tend to let these things slide because they have become such a huge part of what we call sci-fi. 

Hell, even hard sci-fi is bound to be full of made up stuff sprinkled throughout that might as well be magical solutions to gaps in our technology. After all, if you can come up with a plausible way to build cool new technology, you probably shouldn't be writing science fiction... you should be drafting patents.

1342,"The show was originally written as a 5 year arc.  Just before S4 started production it looked like the entire network he was on was going to fail and it was highly unlikely he'd get more than S4 in.  So, he pulled all the ""fluff"" episodes out of S4 and dumped most of the earth/B5 conflict storeline so that everything could be wrapped by the end of S4. 

As S4 was airing things turned around and they were renewed for S5.   The final episode for the show had in fact already been filmed so what he did was film a replacement for the S4/show finale, pulled pulled the original S4/show finale, and started writing S5. That's why S5 stumbles a bit because he put back in some of the stuff he wanted to do but might not be as strong, and stretched out the storylines re earth/B5 that shouldn't have taken a full season.   The final episode of S5/the series that went to air was the episode originally filmed as the end of S4.

Now if you want to watch JMS fall on his face, check out the sequal, Crusade.  The network interfered constantly forcing rewrites on the fly, uniform changes he didn't want, and changes in episode airing that made no sense from a story line point of view. It was so broken.  The funniest part happened online though. Within minutes of the first episode airing people were pointing out that the story was 99.99% a rip off of a classic anime, Star Blazers. Both shows were about an alien race that lost a war with Earth but on the way out poisoned earth.  In both cases the poison was going to take a fixed number of years to adapt to earth and wipe it out.  In both cases Earth adapted technology from mysterious aliens that it barely understood to create a hybrid ship that was sent on a mission to find aliens and/or alien tech that could be used to save the Earth.  In both cases the ship had a ridiculously overpowered main gun that could destroy anything that it fired upon but this alien designed main gun was too powerful for the ship leaving the ship unpowered and helpless for a period of time after the gun was fired.   

If you like reading sci fi there were 3 trilogies that were written based on outlines from JMS that are canon and they are very good.   One explores stories around the Centari, including Vir's ascendancy to the throne that we get a 2 minute glimpse of in the show, one explores the Psi Corp, including a lot on Bester, and one looks at the technomages that we only saw 1 episode of in the show.  The Technomage books also give you some nice insight to both the Vorlon and Shadows.

JMS denied he copied anything but a few days later came back online and said he had gotten a copy of the pilot for the cartoon and having watched it he now remembered seeing it in his youth and admitted he must have been inspired by it without being aware.  Some fans took to referring to the Crusade ship as the Yamato, the name of the ship from the anime.

Crusade didn't make it through its first season.

And yes, Star Trek does do that sometimes, but they do it always to prove a larger point. Q never showed up and brought a character back to life because the plot demanded it, for example. 

But anyway, point being is that all of those other franchises had laws of physics to break. They might not have all gotten explained (some with more success than others), but at least you were left wanting an explanation. In Star Wars, EVERYTHING that happens really might as well be magic, not just one or two unexplainable this. There's zero science.

1364,"Sci-fi is dependent upon one thing: science. Because of that, there's three levels of sci-fi: 

1 - Not sci-fi, but with sci-fi elements - Science, by definition should exist in the story. If it's not, it's just ""fiction with spaceships."" Or, as some people call it, Space Opera. Good examples are Star Wars, Firefly, Fifth Element, and the Michael Bay Transformers movies. Babylon 5 even debatably falls in this category. Most of the MCU is this.

2 - Soft Sci-fi - This is where science is involved in the story and is somehow central, but it gets lofty and might not all make sense. This is most sci-fi. This is Star Trek, The Matrix, BSG, Avatar, Terminator, etc. 

3. Hard sci-fi - This is where hard, factual science is laid out bare and the entire story revolves around science. This doesn't get made into movies or shows very often. You'd be looking at movies like The Martian, Primer, Contact, and Pi. The recent show Devs would also work. More common in books like Neal Stephenson's Seveneves and Cryptonomicon or even Michael Crichton books like Jurassic Park and Sphere.

Of course, there are always things that will straddle these main categories, too. Interstellar, for example, exists somewhere between hard and soft sci-fi. Farscape exists somewhere between soft sci-fi and not sci-fi. I'm not here to argue the nitty gritty details. I'm here to explain where the subcategories are commonly demarcated.",scifi

Still, I will point out (unarmed and from a lower vantage point where I remain unwilling to die) that just about everything in Star Trek from Q, to warp drives, to transporters, to replicators, to time travel, are about as close to magic as you can get in sci-fi. I mean sure... if you say ""I can rearrange molecules and fold space and time to my will"" you are sort of using science words... but you could also be Harry Potter or using an infinity stone. BSG also went off the rails with its ""Kara Thrace is an unexplained force or nature"" and the Matrix had Agent Smith transporting his consciousness into real people... somehow.

That's not to say that all of these sci-fi stories weren't still awesome.

&gt; A for Andromeda is a British television science fiction drama serial first made and broadcast by the BBC in seven parts in 1961. Written by cosmologist Fred Hoyle, in conjunction with author and television producer John Elliot, **it concerns a group of scientists who detect a radio signal from another galaxy that contains instructions for the design of an advanced computer. When the computer is built, it gives the scientists instructions for the creation of a living organism named Andromeda, but one of the scientists, John Fleming, fears that Andromeda's purpose is to subjugate humanity**. 


There is a reference at the end of the Wikipedia page that indicate MGM, the studio behind 'Species', was interested in film rights to 'A For Andromeda'

Garak was someone we didn't really trust until near the end, and for obvious reasons.  Quark was enough of an opportunist to where you couldn't really count on him being a ""good guy"".  Even Odo was put in a position where he was at least forced to question his own loyalties, even if the audience never really did.  

In the end there were still pretty clear lines between good guys and bad guys, but there was also the fact that the villains were portrayed as vulnerable and even sometimes compassionate, like Dukat.  As vile as Dukat and Kai Winn were at the end, you still had the sense that they truly believed they were doing the right thing through most of the story.  

The fact that you on many occasions really wanted to like Dukat made him just that much more evil because you sort of let your guard down to him throughout the series.

Top 5 fav sci-fi TV show franchises for me:

1. The Cowboy Bebop / Carole &amp; Tuesday universe (Great sci fi world building. Both shows, but particularly C&amp;T, incorporate the sci fi elements of the world in subtle delightful ways while really being about the characters.)
2. Babylon 5 (The CG spaceships are SUPER campy if you watch it now, but the story is complex and interesting and spans all the seasons as does the character development.)
3. Stargate (I know there are ""better"" shows, but for some reason I just love this universe, even when it's campy and cringy. I love the pacing at which alien tech gets incorporated into earth's arsenal, the way bit by bit they discovery more about how the gates work, about how the galactic politics are, etc. I dunno. Fun stuff). 
4. Gundam (I mean... there are a million shows within the franchise, but it's basically an epic-scale space conflict in a ""hard"" sci-fi future - I love the orbital colonies, the space cruisers, all of that sci fi stuff in addition to the more obvious ""cool fighting robot suits"")
5. Tales from the Loop (If you haven't checked it out, I highly recommend it. It's like *slow* sci fi, but in a really good way. I was turned off at first because it seemed like an ""episode"" show like black mirror or twilight zone, but it's not, entirely. Each episode focuses on different stuff in the town with different main characters, but those characters stick around as side characters in different episodes, so there's this really strong through-current.

An eight part series set three thousand years in the future. A vast empire, limited only by the galaxy itself, is ruled by the Eternal Emperor, a man who appears to be in his thirties but is in fact over three thousand years old. The source of his power is a powerful fuel called Anti-Matter Two (AM2). It is what fuels everything from the star ships that link the Empire, to industrial factories, to camping heaters. Only he controls its supply and price. It is only for this reason that he is able to rule.

The series follows Sten, a Migrant Worker on the space-station 'Vulcan', chronicling his travels as the Emperor's servant, soldier, diplomat, and spy.

The series' main themes are that of late stage capitalism and the problems inherent to it, authoritarianism and fascist empires, insanity and subjective morality, and monopolies on political power.

1529,"&gt; so don't mind going out of my way to do research as I read.

That's good!

Neal Stephenson's _Anathem_ can be considered a primer in the philosophy of science, and is a great, innovative story.

Stephen Baxter's stories and novels set in the Xeelee Sequence feature all sorts of advanced cosmological topics - cosmic strings, closed time-like curves, etc. - and takes us far into the universe's future, and its earliest beginnings.

I should just have Peter Watts' Blindsight in my paste buffer for virtually any thread here; this book takes a very, very deep dive into neurobiology and consciousness, and comes with a bibliography at the end so you can not only verify that what he says is true, but to keep reading about these topics.

But the ultimate in hard-science-meets-high-concept is Greg Egan. The Clockwork Rocket trilogy re-imagines a 3+1 spacetime with one minor difference, and runs with it; you'll get a whole treatise in cosmology and advanced mathematics. And sociology. Oh, and time travel makes not one, but two appearances. All of his other books are similar - based on hard sciences of mathematics, physics, and philosophy. Check out Dichronauts for a similar ""what if one thing was different"" twist, and basically anything else in his catalog.",scifi

1548,"Haha, I’m not arguing that it was a well-planned or executed shared universe, just that it was one. There were official lists published in some of his books of what was part of the “Future History” in case his intent wasn’t clear enough on its own.

Asimov did things differently in that really he created three separate universes with multiple works in each and then, only in much later works, did he retroactively establish that those three universes were all separate eras within a single timeline. At least Heinlein was making connections all along, minor as most were (though the later stories was where he started to tie in the stuff that really never fit and explain it away as a connected multiverse).

I’m with you in that it wasn’t terribly well-constructed, but if the author says it was a shared universe, and the publisher says it was a shared universe, I’m not here to argue.

I mean, I’m *definitely* here to argue (this is Reddit, after all), but not with ol’ Bob Heinlein.",scifi
1549,"Keeping spoilers light, because there's probably folks like myself who didn't watch it on air, and only recently caught up (or are thinking about finally giving it a watch)....but the tail end of Enterprise had a feeling akin to what I had hoped for Voyager.

1551,"I hear what you're saying but still think it's a bit of a stretch compared to what Asimov did with Robots-Empire-Foundation. Essentially, in Foundation, they are still talking about r Daneel Olivaw and Elijah Baley, which, while classified as sci-fi, were characters in the first robot novels after iRobot (which is referenced in Caves of Steal and other novels in the series). 

I don't think Heinlein ever approached that level of cohesiveness. It's like the idea was there are references were made. Likely he believed they were all in the same universe, but his intent doesn't make it clear.

Also, reviewing all this, was Ender's Game really just a huge rip of Starship Troopers? I never thought about all the similarities before. Must have at least been an influence.",scifi
1552,I feel like I remember a Voyager episode that mentioned them making one.,scifi
1553,"Ham-fisted or not (and I’m not disagreeing with you on that), the author’s intent was a cohesive shared setting. TMiaHM is often included in the Future History list, I’ve even seen some versions that justify SiaSL being there. Starship Troopers, as far as I know, is not connected in any way though. I think there’s a distinction to be made between works that “stands alone” and works that “don’t exist within a shared universe.” Those two ideas aren’t exactly the same. The vast majority of Heinlein’s works (especially the novel-length stuff) stands alone just fine and one can read most of them in any order without realizing any of the connections, but the existence of shared characters and histories within those works implies that those stand alone stories coexist in a single universe (or multiverse) for sure.",scifi

They're all very different people at the end than they were at the start, which isn't really something you can say about the other classic series.  Along the way they examine some interesting questions about politics, religion, faith, friendship, war--basically, many aspects of the human condition. It also holds up a mirror to the Federation and examines it in a way none of the other Star Trek series have done. Heck, it even manages to redeem one of TNG's great shortcomings by making the Ferengi more than just comic relief.  

I don't think DS9 starts slowly at all, but then I really like the character studies that make up the bulk of the early episodes. The rest are largely about setting up the situation with Bajor and its post-occupation rebuilding.It's our first in depth look at a single culture in Star Trek, and I think it works.

One, if Jean-Luc Picard was a REAL french man, he would have said to his crew (and Q... How the fudge doesn't an omniscient entity not know that?): ""No, it's Pee-Kar... You don't pronounce the D at the end!""

Second: Wesley ""We're Starfleet, we never lie"" Crusher. I waited until he was out of the series to start seeing episodes again and any episodes of the TNG series with him in it are not canon as far as I'm concerned.

I'd say the original series is best and the other series after are almost as good (well, those that are canon, anyway).",scifi

Sky Jumpers is another series that is more traditionally SciFi and her new favorite.  

Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh is a wonderful classic, and is a nice introduction to SciFi as it has animal characters.

My 11 year old son loves some of the Heinlein young adult books, like Have Spacesuit Will Travel.

However, I think the last frame should be showing the door slamming shut (calling back to the previous chapter) instead of the silhouette because a double twist doesn't do it for me and it sort of breaks the rules established so far in the universe instead of extrapolating upon them.

I read a lot of TOS novels during the 90s as well, but didn’t have access to the episodes until much later, so while I appreciate them, they’re not at quite the same level of fandom for me.

They could have done his character differently and given the actor some better material that would have been workable: less of a cocky speed jock, and more of a cynic who had (to a real degree) learned his lesson and wizened up, but was also really messed up by his whole scandal story and imprisonment.  (I also hadn't liked that Starfleet imprisonment had been so idyllic, there could have been some interesting and terrible secret to all of that).    


If we had gotten the untrustworthy Chakotay that people are rooting for in this thread overall, then Tom could have been a tortured keystone who saw the ideals of Janeway and his father on one side, but a fellow fight-the-system mentor in Chakotay.

I know it's not a popular opinion, but they did at least pay lip service to the fact that they were mostly on their own.",scifi

Next up- Voyager.  Janeway was a bit dull initially but got better.  Liked the the cast overall and they had cool aliens like the Hirogen.

Enterprise was decent.  T’Pol was hot.

I feel like I am missing something with DS9 that a lot of folks enjoy.  Just seems a little dull with them stuck on that station.

Now, sure Picard isn't the sort to go out and make friends, someone like Riker sure is. 2000 words. Chakotay? 3400. There's just so much more character interaction, and it doesn't seem to be for the benefit of random drama.

There are just too many episodes that would easily be resolved by the person having the issue talking to the captain and the captain believing them but it never seems to happen. If they do manage to talk to someone about their problem no one believes them even though every episodes there is some crazy shenanigans that cause them to question what they know.,scifi
1866,I know I’m gonna get shit for this because voyager is the least liked series I’m pretty sure. But i understand a lot of star trek fans like the civil side of things and don’t really like the combat or violence in the shows. But i liked voyager because i felt like it focused on this. Plus it explores a lot of new ideas that are interesting. I mean they learned to revert a borg to mostly human which led to them getting 7 of 9 which is (pardon me) one of the hottest if not the hottest character in star trek. Then they found a species that was stronger than borg and started hunting them to use their superior tech and they were badass. They had klingons invade their ship and take it over and use their holodeck as hinting simulations and forced them to be prey. We got black vulcans. We got space indians. Shits awesome bruh.

Now, that's not to say that the TNG or Stargate SG-1 or particularly DS9 aren't better. They probably are. But in terms of variety on a week-by-week basis Voyager wins. Even when it's bad at least the bad episodes are more unique from it's other episodes from the others series I mentioned here.

And over time I have come to believe ever more that it's the characters that make a story, that help you suspend your disbelief and just engage with that world.

I thought T'Pol was really just there for eye candy. If they waited a couple of years to round out things a bit, maybe the fans would have been ready for a new series, the stories could have had time to develop, maybe cast a different actress for T'Pol, then it could have had a good seven seasons and ended well instead of the train wreck it turned into.",scifi

He manages to be a 'proper' vulcan, i.e. not one struggling with emotional problems or being half-human, while still feeling 'human'. He has emotions, he keeps them suppressed, but he never feels cold. 

There's also something inherently interesting in being a vulcan - who suppress emotion out of fear of their violence - being a security officer. Admittedly though that's linked to one of voyager's bad points,  many of it's characters had very interesting concepts like him that should have been expanded on, but it so often failed to properly do that. See all of the Maquis who's renegade nature is rarely brought up, or Neelix, who's background is that of a Han Solo figure only pretending to be a fool. At some point, obviously it went wrong.",scifi

* I didn't like Enterprise much on first viewing. Rewatched it last summer and liked it a lot...but the finale is still one of the worst in TV history, definitely the worst Trek finale ever.

* Voyager started out really bad. Starting with season 4 it turned out pretty decent.

* Haven't watched enough of DS9 to form an overall opinion (just random episodes)

* I like Discovery enough, but it feels forced sometimes. LOVE Captain Pike tho, hyped for that series. He saved season 2 of Disc for me.

* The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, A Closed and Common Orbit, and Record of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers are awesome, fun, chill, interesting, and galactic-scale-multi-species-civilization stuff. Fast reads, as well. Each book has a slightly different style and scale to the story, so some folks only like 1 or 2 of them. I honestly liked them all.
* Light by M John Harrison is one of my favorite books. Part space-ship sci fi, part just... weird. Pretty easy to get in to, too. 
* Ancillary Justice and the sequels by Ann Leckie are also some of my favorites. Some folks don't love them because the narrator has some weird perspective stuff going on... but I love them. So, there.
* Other galactic civ/epic scale type stuff... The Uplift series by David Brin (the whole idea of uplifting a primitive species is a part of Stellaris, too, and totally a nod to this series), Culture novels by Iain M Banks, Hyperion Cantos books by Dan Simmons. Binti by Nnedi Okorafor is as well, and is pretty short if you want to get into something quick.",scifi

I heard him talk on a podcast (I think Marc Maron's) about how initially he felt pressured to constantly include his typical low-brow humor and end every scene with a punchline because that's what people had come to expect from him, but that as the writing process continued and he and the other writers started feeling more comfortable with the material that pressure went away and they made a concious decision to put the emphasis on storytelling first and allow the humor to come more naturally where it made sense rather than to force it.

Rogue members\\agents inside of starfleet has been done to death in almost every ST series as well and in the movies.

YASSSS...

Mostly because it's an obvious love letter but what really won me over was the way the moral quandaries are rarely tied off with a neat little bow. 

Hard situations do not magically become easy when someone gives a speech; these issues remain ugly and unjust as often as not, and we get to see people live with them and adapt to them. That's a brave thing to do in an American show that doubles as a space opera romp. It never flinches but it also never wallows. It may wear its values on its sleeve just the way Trek always has, but it also recognizes the improbability of the utopian vision and it never feels preachy, but somehow it remains fundamentally hopeful.

That's something you can only pull off if you love the source material and actively want it to be better.

Most Trek shows post Voyager have all the superficial elements down, but they lack the beating heart of Star Trek, its sense of wonder and hope (IMHO). Orville has that heart.",scifi

He takes it upon himself to look out for the morale of the crew who should all reasonably be feeling pretty hopeless and extremely overworked.  Which he probably does to distract himself from his own depressing reality, and then the crew usually just turns around and treats him like an annoying clown who's desperate for attention.

In my mind, at least, it's something even deeper.  TOS was *heavily* shaped by it's times - blending hippy hope and color schemes with the deepening cold war, and you can really see those influences.  

The Orville replaces the upbeat togetherness 60's hippy culture with cynical Gen-X, but still manages to keep the optimism.

Fuck Earth, I'm staying here with the weirdos who froze Amelia Earheart."" I know the did that toward the end w/ the borg kids, but it would've been cool.

Archer's desparation is handled well, and explains some of the acts he commits while on the mission, but it's clear they had the shadow of not just 9/11 but of Battlestar Galactica haunting them.

Battlestar Galactica's MAJOR problem was that in a lazy examination of how people deal with terrorism or torture or something basically became nearly unwatchable as it had turned largely into Battlestar Giraqtica , complete with a meditation on the torturers and the tortured. Enterprise suffered similarly.

I think such examinations are absolutely critical and necessary sometimes, but I couldn't help reflect back on the situation with Babylon 5, and how when one of the major characters is being coerced for a confession, instead of beating someone or spacing them or plucking an eye out, the genius of writing makes Babylon 5 a study in contract, [in how it should be done], was to take a mild-mannered interrogator, simple hunger and turn a sandwich [into a sadistic exercise.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwtncUWXxoQ).

PARTS of Season 4 are awesome, the Andorian/Aenar arc was fairly awesome. The situation where the rumblings of the birth of the Federation were excellent and I will even say that parts of the arc for Terra-Prime were really good, but I CANNOT agree with you as to how they treated the main characters.

The first couple episodes of the first season were rough, and you can tell he sold it to the network as ""family guy in space"" but after about 3-4 episodes it's like he met the networks mandated quota of dick jokes and made the show a serious TNG clone with some comedy elements.

It felt like Disco and Picard never formed real ‘crews’. It seemed more to be about the individual in conflict with Starfleet/the federation. That’s always been more of a StarWars theme.

2060,"Dune is amazing.  It's my favorite and most read fiction book after Hitchhiker's Guide.

Dune is fantastic for many reasons, but I'm gonna focus on the two main aspects I love.

First, the world building is some of the best that's ever occurred.  Herbert cared more about the world of Arrakis than he did about the story being told.  And this really comes through.  Even if I didn't care about Paul or the Harkonnens, I still feel like I've visited Arrakis and spent a good part of my life there.  Everything is fleshed out, from the people to the culture to the religion.  And there are so many points that are barely made in passing that make the world so rich.  Why do you need mentats?  Because thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human brain - due to the Butlerian Jihad.  What was that?  The book doesn't directly tell you, you have to infer that there was some robot uprising thousands of years ago that is still shaping this culture.

Second, the book is perhaps the best modern example of old story telling.  From the greeks to shakespeare, stories were often spoiled at the very beginning.  A play would begin with a five minute miming of the major points.  People didn't care about twists or turns.  They wanted to see good execution.

Anyways, Dune is like that, except you don't realize it at first.  EVERYTHING in Dune is not only foreshadowed, it is blatantly foreshadowed in almost exact ways.  You are told the ending in the first few chapters of the book.  But you fight it, you fight the certainty, you fight the spoiler, just like Paul constantly fights against his visions of the permanent jihad.  You are given the foresight that the Kwisatz Haderach is given and you fight against it the same as he does.  It was on my third read through that I was able to spot every spoiler and see just how blatant and obvious it is.  But, because of how the book is written, the obviousness is hidden from the casual reader.

The world and the way the story is told is even better than the story and its characters.

&amp;#x200B;

edit:  I wanted to add something else that's really cool.  While Dune is set in a completely foreign universe, so many of the stories are real historical stories from the Caucus mountains.  If you read Sabres of Paradise you will see so many real life examples that Herbert seamlessly integrated.",scifi

Yeah; that's from disco, I assumed that was what you were thinking about as it's really the only example of a gay relationship in Trek I could think of. It's pretty good in my book, the relationship (not their sexuality) is important to the characters and informs their responses and emotions, but is not the focus of the episodes/show at any point.

I would argue it is less that people have moved away from sublety and more that writing relationships is hard and people have always written a lot of bad stuff. The move to shorter seasons exacerbates this bc it's even harder to write convincing romance when you have 8-12 episodes to do it instead of 20.

&gt; I don't feel the need to push the envelope on acceptance, I let people freely make up their own minds, even in their attitudes about race.

This is the only issue I have with your thinking. People are regularly murdered and harrassed due to their race, gender, religion, and sexuality. It is very clear that you live in an area or are of a group that doesn't have these issues in the forefront of public life, but for a lot of people, constant vigilance and awareness is a survival skill.
There is a place for fun blow stuff up sci fi, but Star Trek has built a legacy of arguing against the kind of complacency that allows us to say that the KKK, nationalist hate groups, and other hateful people are ""someone else's problem"". Star Trek has always been explicitly political and should remain so. Our entertainment serves to normalize and encourage thinking, regardless of whether there is an intended message, dismissal of this does not change that fact.

We may have to part in continued disagreement, but I urge you to consider that if you choose to ""let people make up their minds"" you are not being impartial, you are explicitly declaring that you like things the way they are. That is a political position, whether you intend it to be or not.

There's an older complete version available as well (Legend of the Galactic Heroes), but it's not available with and English dub (my personal preference), and it's fairly old, so the animation style is quite dated, that being said it's one of the most highly regarded anime out there, so I would also put it out there for your consideration.

**Star Blazers** or **Space Battleship Yamato 2199/2202** is another anime rebooted series that's pretty good and still ongoing.

**Knights of Sidonia** (Anime) is another one I'd recommend. Some people don't like the CGI animation style, but *Polygon Pictures* did this one, and I tend to find their animation style, works pretty well with their general art aesthetic. I'd also toss out a recommendation for the movie **Blame!**, which actually gets referenced in KoS, and is by the same studio.

I'd also highly recommend the **HALO** franchise. By which I mean, not just the games, but also the books, and possibly even some of the comics. I originally played all of the campaigns (up through HALO 4), and enjoyed them, but always thought they seemed a bit shallow, like there was a lot more going on, but just brushed it off as lazy writing for games that were more focused on multiplayer. Then I started playing 5 and was like *What the hell? There are other Spartan IIs running around?*. So, I looked up what was going on and realized there's a whole set of books and comics that delve into the going ons of the HALO universe and they're all canon. So, I started cranking through the books (I went with the audiobook route) and was kinda amazed at how much more fleshed out the whole universe was, and how the stories from the game made waaay more sense and had much more depth to them. So, if you're interested in playing the campaigns, or already have, I'd at least recommend reading the main storyline books (Fall of Reach, The Flood (which is basically the Halo 1 campaign in story form, with the added bonus of knowing what the hell everybody else is doing while Master Chief is running around kicking ass), First Strike, and Ghosts of Onyx, will take you through the Halo 3 campaign), but I'd really recommend almost all of them, including the anthologies, as well as the movies/miniseries/anime and Halo Wars games, since they also contain some great stories that shed some light on what's going on both during and in between the games, and add/explain a lot of the in-universe lore. I'd also like to add here that the HALO books have some of my favorite space battles in Sci-Fi, particularly in the first book, The Fall of Reach.

I'd also be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to **Battlestar Galactica**, a quintessential space opera. As well as **The Expanse**.

There's also a whole host of other shows that scratch my personal Sci-Fi itch, without maybe being quite as epic, like the Stargate franchise, Dark Matter, Killjoys, Falling Skies, and Defiance.

I can't say anything about this. Is this from Discovery? I never watched an episode of that show.

I'm low on many romantic relationships in sci-fi. Basically, if sexuality is front and center in a show, I stop watching. Definitely true for straight characters, too. So I look at hetero relationships in a similar negative light - like the writers/producers are just trying too hard. I prefer romantic relationships to have more subtlety, and recent television has definitely moved away from that. 

I have an issue with the idea that every show has to have x, y, and z to be considered acceptable.

Even a rationale for where evolution could one day ascending to higher planes of existence as pure energy.

I was always fascinated by the concept of the ancients being the first major developed race in the galaxy.

Equally as intriguing on the other side of the coin, where we may one day discover an ancient races existing with the possibility of billions of years headstart over us.

I know this may come across as somewhat confrontational, but if you imagined the same plots with straight characters (in trek, again I don't watch the same things as you) would it be an issue? If not, maybe the problem is not with the shows writing. We all have implicit biases, I certainly have had moments where something rubbed me the wrong way and I have had to stop and say ""why do I have an issue with it? Would I have this issue if X was different?"".

I can't imagine you are saying that the act of including gay relationships at all is ""hackish"", but you don't specify what your actual issue is? Is it the fact that it is ""pandering""?

&gt; ... Yes, I watched. Profound ""Meh"" from me.

First couple episodes were meh for me. Later I became a fan. ... But the show has had some issues and made some missteps. (And when I look at the show from ""outside my fanbrain"", I can ""understand"" why [some people dislike it](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/reviews?sort=submissionDate&amp;dir=asc&amp;ratingFilter=1).) Speaking for myself though, I try to look past the flaws and enjoy the show for what it is.

&gt; ... Why did no one watch it?

With 91K user rating votes on IMDb, and a subreddit subscriber count of 125K (recently surpassing the Firefly sub's 121K), shouldn't those numbers be lower if ""no one"" watched the show? ¯\\(ツ)\/¯

If as you say, basically ""no one"" was watching it, then in 2018 after Amazon [picked it up](https://deadline.com/2018/05/the-expanse-amazon-picks-up-1202398511/) you might've wondered [why did Amazon do that](https://deadline.com/2018/06/amazon-studios-the-expanse-saved-1202407447/)? ¯\\(ツ)\/¯ — Why did they *not only* pick it up for the fourth season, but promptly *renew* it for a fifth?

Starfleet clearly has SOME uniform and conduct codes. And if you think about it because of the wide-spread use of personal translators, the use of profane language while on-duty is probably a big ""no-no"" in Starfleet.

Maybe this is a big deal to some, but as much as I love Roddenberry if he thought humanity would give up using profanity in a mere 200 years that is, by a WIDE margin, the least believable part of Star Trek.

I'm not an illustrator or designer, so I can't give too much feedback on that front, but I think you should read up on different font types. Arial is so ugly and boring.

All of these movies have VFX in them. If you actually had the spatial reasoning capacity greater than a rhesus monkey, you should be able to *infer* that is, deduce or conclude (information) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements that there will be VFX in ""Dune."" 

Further, you should also be able to *infer* that because these movies took a sizable amount of time to be made and that the same guy did it twice beforehand, he obviously knows how to work with VFX teams because it's an important part of the movie.

Many shows seem hell-bent on pushing issues in heavy-handed ways, either to seem relevant, or as some kind of righteous crusade, or because they think the pandering gets them more viewers. Usually pandering loses them viewers, but they haven't realized that yet. For instance, the NFL lost A LOT of viewers and fans over the kneeling/flag thing, although to be fair it was the absolute right call on the NFL's part not to force players to kneel before their American flag-god.

TOS was boundary-pushing for its time. A black woman officer? A Russian and an Asian guy and whatever else, although they were often caricatures or stereotypes and we look back on that stuff now as being kind of silly. Still, I think the show did some great things for its time in breaking down racial barriers. The newer shows, especially DS9 and Voyager, did that much better IMO, because guys like Avery Brooks and Garrett Wang and Tim Russ were just good actors and good characters that could have been there as tokens but ended up being anything but. On the other hand, the slew of recent shows trying to stage gay relationships in a trendy way now just comes across as hackish.

I'm also reading The Fifth Season, which is a bit of a mix between sci fi and fantasy. It has some amazing worldbuilding on par with Sanderson IMO. It's getting a TV series adaption too, which will be awesome if done well.

Kingkiller is great, really fun story and the characters and magic system are well written. It's not a typical novel though, doesn't really have a start-middle-end so I think you have to treat each book as a slice of an overall story.",scifi

Basically in this story there is an Alien spire that floats 6 feet above an abandoned moon far away from where most of civilization is in the galaxy. It has a series of rooms that have puzzles of ever increasing complexity. Those puzzles are inscribed around doors that get smaller ever so slightly through each room. I don't want to ruin anything but between the Spire and its extraterrestrial fucked up nature and the way the characters need to modify/mutilate their bodies to handle the inhuman complexity of the puzzles and fit through doors that are too small for all their old bones is Grieger and Biomechanical as best I can imagine in writing.

This is set in Reynolds ""Revelation Space"" anthology. It has stories ranging from 300 to 40 billion years from now. A few of the cultures and characters from that world hit the Grieger Biomechanical vibe.",scifi

However, the separation of the text bubbles from the graphics really takes away from the experience rather than enhancing it.

As long as there is discrimination and inequality I think its important we have representation in media for everyone to identify with but not everything has to be a statement. It's much more compelling to have a strong female lead completely comfortable with who she is and the story focuses on the normal things that character encounters. I think Supergirl does this with Dreamer who is trans, a lot better. She's just a person and there's no contrived statements or catchphrases just because she is transgender.

edit: spelling",scifi

2365,"Not offended at all. Not everything has to be made for my tastes. I do avoid shows that throw it in your face in really clumsy ways. Take Batwoman for example on CW, the main character is a Lesbian which is fine except they make a point of having that be 90% of her identity and in the foreground all the time so instead of a powerful female icon who happens to like girls it lacks subtlety and she comes across as a very two dimensional character with lesbian catch phrases.

Shows with hetero leads don't make the story about their sexuality, it just is - and I get that hetero relationships have had the luxury of ""just being""-  and in that way its more organic and flows better. So my view is that many LGBTQ content makers undermine how many audiences they could reach by falling into this trap of ironically filling their writing with exclusionary statements at the cost of story.",scifi

Specifically, mankind discovers portals that connect us to other parts of the universe, but they effectively function like transporters-- you get beamed between portals at the speed of light, and assembled on the other end. Portal is 10 light years away? It takes 10 years to get there.

Certain people get employed as couriers to move between the portals, and initially, it's considered a very lucrative job. You spend a few months in space, then 20 years travelling between portals, and when you're finally back home, compound interest has made you rich. 

But society eventually turns against these people, who return home to find they're broke and all their friends are dead or aged significantly.

I would have sworn this was part of the Manifold series, but re-reading the descriptions, it doesn't seem like them.

People pour lavish undue praise on his writing. The prologue is one overlong empty metaphor. And there are points where he leans heavy on adverbs (in fact, he uses the same adverb in the same way at least four or five times on one page).

The main character doesn't have many flaws, and when he does make a mistake, the consequences don't have much bearing. The second book devolves into an extended sex fantasy where the author describes the sex using a naming system rather than actually painting a picture (A Thousand Hands is a paraphrased example).

He does good work with the metafictional aspects, and the construction of Sympathy as a magic system is intriguing, but all that falls flat when faced with a plot that doesn't know where its going and a story that is populated with wooden characters.",scifi

Stephenson in general is a fantastically talented author. 

Also more traditional sci-fi, but THE THREE BODY PROBLEM is a great book that starts an excellent trilogy. Fairly philosophical, but lots of interesting mythology, history, and technology as well. Its one of my favorite books I've read in years.

They’re not what I’d normally think of when I hear the words “Science fantasy”, sort of the opposite really. Instead of being a future world with fantasy elements, they’re more a premodern world with science elements. It’s a really cool look at the idea of “ What if someone with modern knowledge was sent back in time.” except instead of being sent back in time they’re sent to another planet full of pre-modern cultures.

2437,"I Have read the entire series twice with the exception of the Brian Herbert House books. For me, I loved the atmosphere and the universe that inhabits these books",scifi
2438,"These may have already been listed, but in the order of just how gripping I have found them:

The Masquerade series (currently 2 books, with the third of four coming out in a few months)  - *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* and *the Monster Baru Cormorant*, by **Seth Dickinson**. I read the original *Dune* sextet over the summer before my freshman year of high school and nothing I have read since then has ever been as compelling...until this. I generally don't cry over books, either, but I openly wept at multiple points reading them. I'm not sure how to describe them - whether as fantasy, sci-fi, steam/diesel/other-punk, historical fiction or what - but the series takes place in a mostly realistic not-earth world and follows the namesake protagonist as she grapples with the legacies of progress, imperialism, colonialism, power, intelligence and truth.  Truly, I wept over these books.

After the Masquerade, I would recommend the following series by **Gene Wolfe**: *The Book of the New Sun* and its immediate follow-on work, *The Urth of the New Sun*. These are the opening salvo of a multi-series arc in a shared milieu. They're followed by *The Book of the Long Sun* (a tetralogy) and *The Book of the Short Sun* (a trilogy). In total, there are 12 books in this series. While the stories didn't make me literally weep, they're the most exquisitely written science fiction that I have ever encountered in the English language (and some of the best English language writing I've encountered, period). And the stories *are* gripping.

Next, I would point you equally at anything by **China Miéville** or **Iain M Banks**. As for Mr. Miéville, I'm particularly fond of *The Scar* (part of his Bas-Lag universe, along with *Perdido Street Station* and *Iron Council)* and the stand-alone works *Kraken* and *The City and the City* (the last being also more of a realistic fiction than pure science fiction). Regarding Mr. Banks, I'm presently reading through *Consider Phlebas*, the first book (in order of release date) in his Culture Milieu; I finished *The Hydrogen Sonata* (the *last* book to be released before his death) in about a week and a half at the start of quarantine. I have 5 more of his books queued up at present (*Excession* is next on my list). As an aside, had I stumbled into Mr. Bank's books instead of *Dune,* I am not sure precisely *how* my life (interior and exterior) would be different than today, but I know it would be radically so.

Finally, I also have to give extensive props to runners up **Greg Bear** (check out the duologies composed of *Queen of Angels* and / \[pronounced *Slant\]*, and *The Forge of God* and *The Anvil of Stars)*, **Greg Egan** (his works are abstruse and technical, yet mindblowing and, even if you don't have a good grasp of the math, are entirely readable), and a special favorite of mine that no one seems to have heard of - **Patricia Anthony,** who wrote a bunch of great sci-fi novels in the late 90's and early 00's, of which *God's Fires* (which is about how a village in Inquisition Era Portugal deals with a crashed alien spacecraft and its occupants) is my personal favorite.

The wheel of time is VERY good some say it gets long winded but the world building is spectacular and how it seems to sub genre switch is also good. Going from lotr style high fantasy into deep politics and then military fantasy. A lot of stuff by Raymond e feist is good magician especially. If you fancy something quick and fun you can’t beat David gemmell. Waylander being a personal favourite of mine. If you want something that’s very self aware the Belgariad by David Eddings is a fun read all the tropes and it knows it. If you like a song of ice and fire the dragon bone chair is also good.

But unless the instant message machine also works in their (moving) frame, they can't take advantage of this to send info into the past.

Anyway, it's an ugly loophole, but it's enough to justify an SF story with FTL but without time travel.",scifi

2529,"I think it’s because, as an IP, Star Trek is beyond the point of taking significant creative risks. That’s why in DISCO the main character is raised by Spock’s father, and Spock shows up in Season 2 because they want to keep reusing the most iconic aspects to make sure people know it’s “Star Trek.” Having it be a prequel is good for them because they don’t have to expend any creative energy creating something even more futuristic and risk the audience rejecting a totally new look and concept. 

The only reason PIC is post Voyager is because it’s staring Captain Picard. They are again, relying on the most iconic aspect of ST because new protagonists are a hard sell for them. Michael Burnham is kind of unlikable. And even PIC isn’t rally that innovative or new in the context of mainstream sci-fi or even Star Trek. Tech wise they have more hologram people, but we got that in VOY. The digital displays are new for Star Trek but old to everyone else if you’ve seen the Marvel movies.

2540,"You could also use that same “hive mind” accusation and apply it to other segments of StarTrek fandom who say any criticism of modern Trek as “hating” and do mental gymnastics to justify poor writing.

TOS was the first, and caught on big time in syndication and made a big impact on pop culture.

TNG ended up being very successful during its time. Both this show and the original are generally praised by Trek fans and critics alike.

VOY struggled the whole time with ratings and is generally criticized by Trek fans and critics to this day.

Same with ENT. It struggled with ratings to point it got cancelled and there was no new Trek for years. Even now it’s generally viewed as not as good as the first two ST incarnations.

So maybe it’s not just some fans hating anything that’s new, but maybe many of the shows that have come after just aren’t that good compared to what else is out there. TNG has some bad episodes and a weak first two seasons but it was still innovative for its time and there wasn’t many other options for TV sci-fi at the time.

Now there’s an abundance of sci-fi on television, not to mention the access of classic sci-fi shows available due to streaming, so the landscape is more competitive these days, the standards higher. It’s not doing “nuTrek” any favors to compare it to certain episodes/seasons from 30-50 years ago and say, “well those ones were bad too!” 

As far as The Orville goes there’s definitely a few weak episodes in he first season. But overall I personally find the characters to be interesting and very likable. The majority of the individual episodes are great. I also find that this silly Star Trek-meets-Family Guy show has more genuine emotional moments than the forced melodrama of PIC.",scifi

Even Asimov's Foundation series pales in comparison and they're about to do a video series on that one I hear (why Dune never got the ""Game of Thrones"" treatment I'll never understand). Herbert wrote during the golden years of science fiction when much of the ideas we now consider cliche were first offered by the likes of Asimov, Clarke and Bradbury. There is nothing cliche about Dune, even today. It is just as viable a story as it was forty years ago when I firs read it. I think it's longevity is due to the reason many people don't like it, too much detail, too many bizarre names, too much politics, too much philosophy. Dune went far beyond anything that has been written to date in scope and detail (IMHO). Which is why it is so re-readable. You get something new out of it every time you read it.",scifi

2562,"Timothy Zahn's books (sci-fi): 

Check out the Cobra Wars books. There are a number of books in this setting. Baen has a trilogy collection available. https://www.baen.com/the-cobra-trilogy.html

If you were a Star Wars fan, The Thrawn trilogy of Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command, are imo, some of the best books that were written in the Star Wars universe. They are set after RotJ. His recent Thrawn prequel trilogy, which is Thrawn's backstory of how he came to the Empire, is also awesome. But if you're going to read any of the Thrawn books, start with Heir. 

L.E. Modesitt Jr. - The Saga of Recluce (fantasy)

The series started with The Magic of Recluce. The stories, often told in pairs, are set across the breath of the universe's timeline. He has done a great job telling the story around different events from the perspective of different sides. For example, The Magic Engineer and The White order are set in the same part of the timeline, but each tells the story of a war from the perspective of a character on different sides of the conflict.

2568,"To me, Annihilation is about self destruction and the forms that it can take, and how it changes us. Apologies in advance because I'm terrible with names, but here goes-

Almost everyone that went into the bubble (that lived long enough to be changed by it)  had some self destructive tendencies before going in, workaholics, people that self harm, people that routinely cheat. They all were using something to scratch the itch of being unsatisfied with their life, albeit unsuccessfully.

Then they get confronted with something that can actually effect real change, on every conceivable level. 

Most of the characters let themselves go completely into the void and willfully let it overtake them (The woman who turned into flowers, the way that the woman seeking knowledge interfaced with the alien right before Portman's confrontation at the end) they all embraced the change, and let themselves be fully destroyed by that change. 

The main character is the only one who isn't completely swallowed up by the change, but she is still forever a different human after her experience. Perhaps she was an allegory for those that stare suicide in the face, see that change on the other side, and reject it to emerge stronger on the other side. Perhaps she's finally saying ""No, this form will not perish. Who I am may be flawed, but I will own these flaws now. I will conquer them.""

How deeply does the audiobook cover Feyd-Rautha and his intentions? The seduction of Feyd-Rautha by the Ambassador's wife (the Ambassador being a cuckold at best)?

2- The Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson: This guy's just a good author. I couldn't put these down when I read all three early this year.

3- Eragon: The movie was garbage, but the book series is good.

The Dark Forest theory is pretty great, but unlikely. Humans (or, intelligent life) has already realized it is better for survival to cooperate rather than execute that theory. Although if you think about it, the Dark Forest theory is very applicable to life in the animal kingdom, pre-civilization.

Death’s End had some great ideas but I really didn’t like the characters. He tried to show how femininity is portrayed as weak but isn’t really weak after all - and this latter part didn’t really come through too well.

Some people like plot; Dune is fairly cliché when it comes to plot.  Good guys, bad guys, mysterious guys.  Betrayal by trusted companions.  Women struggling to fill their social roles.  Marriage for love and not for politics.  Good guy wins in the end.  Then, marriage for politics and not for love.

Some people like characters; Dune is also cliche when it comes to characters.  Leto good, Harkonnen bad.  Good guy's friends are the best guys.  Bad guys are so evil they even hate natural beauty.  Bad guys are so stupid they fail to see what is under their noses.

&gt;**- What can readers expect from the two sequels and the trilogy that will follow this one?**

&gt;*Well.... I've already written them. So you won't have to wait forever for them to come out. They'll be released on a regular schedule. One per year.*

&gt;*You can also expect the second book to be written with the same degree of care and detail as this first one. You know the sophomore slump? When a writer's second novel is weaker because they're suddenly forced to write under deadline? I don't have to worry about that because my next two novels are already good to go.*

One per year. ONE PER YEAR. This was 13 years ago.",scifi

You could say that it was all trauma and PTSD and flashbacks from WW2, but that's only when you add the perspective of Kurt Vonnegut's time in WW2.

I enjoyed reading those books too. But I don't like getting involved in series that have a good setup and no payoff. I like my stories to end. And I'm mad that Rothfuss went out of his way to promise that this wouldn't happen, only for him to turn out exactly like GRR Martin. 

Sure, those authors don't owe anyone anything, really. But I don't want to get invested in stories that won't finish, and so I prefer reading authors who can deliver the merchandise more than those with a promising start who then are paralyzed afterwards.

2731,"Wereworld is pretty good.  Basically a medieval fantasy story, where all the nobles are some type of werecreature.  I jokingly called it Song of Ice &amp; Fire, but with furries.  It obviously draws inspiration.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevernight is a pretty good trilogy (really good on audible).  A young woman trains and becomes an assassin in order to avenge her family.  World appears to be a fictional Roman Empire style world.  The assassins she joins are like a religious cult (think Dark Brotherhood from Elder Scrolls series).  Its called Nevernight, because this world has 3 suns, and it is only ever dark once every few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Stormdancer is also a good trilogy (same author as Nevernight).  It takes place in a steampunk Japan.  A plant called ""the lotus"" is being used for everything from airship fuel to drugs.  Its also poisoning the planet.  The main character has the ability to communicate with animals (which marks her as a ""witch"" to be burned, in this universe).  She eventually makes a pact with a griffon in order to save her father.",scifi
2732,"The Bas-Lag trilogy by China Mieville. Phantastic world-building, interesting, multi-faceted characters,  some alien, some not, some 50/50. Plus every book belongs to a diferent sub-genre. While they are all clearly fantasy, they have a kind of steampunk atmosphere to them. Perdido Street Station is a noir crimi/horror novel, The Scar has pirates and whatnot and Iron Council has strong Western elements. 

It's mentioned in another reply, but only as a comment and I can't recommend these books enough.",scifi

It is very dense and essentially a encyclopedia of stories from this universe. It’s well written, good plot, good characters, and all of that. The shining point is the world building which is beyond the scope of anything listed above. The only thing that comes close is wheel of time which op said he had to put down. 

Malazan is phenomenal. My favorite books. But it’s not for everyone.",scifi

2736,"True, just phasers and torpedos won't do it. I did like some of what was done on DS9 with the war, but even so, we didn't see enough (in my opinion) of the terrorist cells and their work, and battles going on away from the station. And you know, there's only so much you can do with a space station shooting lasers at a ship, or deploying mines or whatever. You've got to continually ramp up that tension in the fight sequences. So, in space battles, maneuver and counter-maneuver is not so bad, but it almost always has to be focused on the interior of the ship.

Personally, I'd like to see the planetary stuff maxed out moreso than space battles. Where they are traveling, interacting, even fighting in new places, either with new alien races or against old adversaries.",scifi
2737,"Yeah, it is not stated anywhere in the first book that the Biologist is indigenous. That is only stated in the third book.

Speaking of ASOIAF I have to admit that reading the Majipoor series first kind of ruined ASOIAF for me, because I felt like the first couple of books or so were building up to the humans being a non-native species, with Bran being the ""white savior"" of the north.

I’d like to see it be more cinematic, certainly. Show, don’t tell. But, phaser battles and chase sequences should be kept minimal. 

TNG was at its best when the obvious choice was for Picard, Warf &amp; Riker to fuck shit up. Worst case they send the fucking android and its super strength. 

But, Picard was level headed. He’d call a Klingon Captain a bIHnuch P'takh to his face and watch him do nothing. Then, offer his hand in friendship.

2824,"I've a few thoughts on this movie, some of which gel nicely, others which clash or diverge wildly, but here goes:

1. Lena isnt who she claimed to be. Much like the Alien she reflects back what she believes is correct. In this case she projects the image of the loyal wife. 

2. Lena damages and changes the relationship much like the Alien damages and changes the characters own DNA.

3. Her hubby (Isaac, cant recall the character name) is also damaged/changed by her.

4. Hubby may also have been projecting a more humane self to her (mimicry? Inherited self-imaging based on social standards? Survival) but she saw a more primal demented violent version of him when he sliced open his comrades stomach and showed excitement at his findings within.

5. Speaking of - the snake thing within the stomach is to me an allegory for the human outside and the beast within.

6. Earth is a biome which becomes host to the Shimmer (a cancer). The Shimmer is a biome which then hosts the two squads. As the Shimmer expands across its host, influencing and changing it, so do the squads influence and change the biome of the Shimmer.

7. OR the Shimmer is spacetime reacting to the arrival of this zone/entity, and the morphing/absorption/transference is less a conscious or instinctive element of the Shimmer, and more a result of spacetime itself changing, and those who inhabit it (humans and fauna being baryonic matter completely beholden to the warping of spacetime) merging and mutating as a natural (or unnatural) consequence.

8. The object which kills and absorbs the squad leader seems to either be a conscious mind manifest, or a multidimensional portal converting matter to pure energy and converting it into Lena 2.0. Either way it is to my mind a Shimmer mirror image or a spacetime self-replication (as matter/energy are part of, not inhabitants in, spacetime).

9. Hubby returns a husk or a changeling. We cannot know if he is the same person because in truth no one is. Everything and everyone changes and the scale of this cha gets hinges on the trigger event, its lasting impact, and of the perception of the observer.

10. Lena too has changed as a result of (a) damaging her marriage (b) suffering emotional trauma and guilt and shame (c) facing and interacting with the Shimmer (d) absorbing some of her squad's identity (see the tattoo) (e) facing herself and seeing both exact copy and trans dimensional copycat (f) re-emerging both unsure of herself and her hubby 

I think this film is far less about alien encounters and far more about what we dont know or understand about ourselves and others, and the actions we and they take, and the impact that can have both on our psyches and on our moral balances.

It's not a perfect movie by any means, I felt disconnected from the characters which going by Devs may be intentional, but for me didnt work. I also missed the first-person perspective of the first book and the intensity of the underground tunnel she found there, it felt a lot more personal and the stakes far higher. But i still love Garland's singular vision and admire his ventures into the human mind via half sci fi have gothic horror pathways.",scifi

2855,"In the book, several members of various expeditions into Area X mysteriously reappear in society, but in the movie, it’s just Kane.

My theory for the film is that the alien in Area X used Kane to learn how to copy itself into a human form that could plausibly pass for a normal human being in society. This failed, however, when the copy of Kane wasn’t able to retain his personality or proper organ function and promptly started dying outside of Area X.

The alien then used Lena to learn how to make a better copy of a human, one who could seem like she was destroying Area X, one who could return to tell the tale, one who could keep Lena’s personality, one who could somehow cure Kane so that the alien could keep reproducing in society undetected.

So even though we think we see Lena destroying the alien in the lighthouse, that’s not really Lena. Because the bodies “switch” when Lena blacks out.

Thematically, the theory is supported by the idea that Lena (Lena’s clone) seems like she’s teaching the alien (Lena) how to self destruct using the phosphorus grenades, but she eventually runs away rather than self-destructing. So it’s not really an act of self-destruction but murder of the other. The alien never learns the concept of self-destruction and so continues existing in/as Lena.",scifi
2856,"The 'Skylark' series is the other EE Doc Smith series - 'Lensman' is more of a ""Galactic Police"" series (like Buzz Lightyear's ""Space Rangers"" or the ""Green Lantern Corps"") whereas 'Skylark' is more of a ""Lost in Space"" series (super scientist constantly building bigger/faster/stronger ships and going on adventures with friends/family/rival).

I've read both series and find them really interesting in a historical way.  They're some of the first examples of ""space opera"" science fiction -  written around 100 years ago - and influenced so much stuff that came after.  However, before I'd recommend these to anyone there's some huge things to deal with. 

Since so many things have copied from it, it falls into the trap of [Seinfeld is Unfunny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny).  It's also super dated (I mean, as expected...) - in language, social attitudes, storytelling, etc.  For language - it's not like 'The Canterbury Tales' or Shakespeare levels - but there are tons of phrases/slang/etc. from the time period it was written.  As for social attitudes - it's not actually as bad as most fiction from this period - I'm sure it was super progressive for the 1920's.  He doesn't write women all that well, but at least generally treats them as well as other male characters.  There's a lot of 'pedastalizing' though.  As far as I can remember, all the characters are pretty much default white... other than Shiro (main character's butler/manservant... shades of the 'The Green Hornet') and his wife Lotus Blossom ( who is always described as ""small and dainty"" or ""a living doll"" but also ""one of the most proficient female experts in unarmed combat then alive""). On the storytelling front - All the heroes are always the best at everything and could even teach Kvothe how to be an even better Mary Sue. Deus ex Machina is their way of life.  Lots of cool scenes, but also a lot of telling instead of showing and infodumps. No real qualms with wiping out entire alien civilizations because it's justified because they're apparently 100% evil (even the women... and the children...).

I feel like, instead of directly bringing 'Skylark' or 'Lensman' series to the screen, most people chose to take aspects of it and adapt it into their own story.  It would be cool to see an updated version of these stories - despite all the complaints above they are good fun stories - but I also worry that these would have the same problems as [John Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carter_(film)).",scifi

Some are born with a strong affinity to order, others to chaos, and some who try to balance both, and this determines the kinds of spells and magic the wizard can perform.  The books are not written in chronological order, instead jumping around in time over the course of about 1900 years, so it almost doesn't matter what order you read them in, though some books do have the same main characters, so you might want to start with the first book a particular character behind in.

Everyone should just admit there is never going to be a show like Farscape that has broad appeal. That way we can be realistic about budgets and expected audiences, and close out all the story arcs.  How hard would it be for a buyer to commit to 3 seasons of a show to increase the chances of something good happening, and also increase their viewer trust level.

I think Star Trek is an amazing property and if they just made good episodes like TNG, DS9, and Voyager all did, we could be happy. Even if there is a percentage of people who see it as mediocre or passe, lots of people will watch for the same reason that lots of people read typical fantasy books with swords and dragons and mages.

Was it to show how the Federation cracks under pressure? DS9 did that 25 ago and much, much better.

Did it want to be gritty? Possibly, but with a little bit of low light, some curses and some casual sex and torture you're not getting anyone to talk about your grittiness in 2020. BSG did that over a decade ago. If you want to be gritty today, be *Altered Carbon*.

Does it want to be a *drama*? Alright, fine... that's probably closest to what it actually is. But I might as well pretend that The OC is on a spaceship.

Season 2 was the same kind of mess, setting up some space-faith stuff (DS9 *and* BSG did that better), just to abandon that halfway through for space-travel machine uprising (everybody did that better).

&gt; Discovery is definitively better than ""Another Life"" and I would say on par with ""Lost in Space"" if you consider the second season.

Oh maybe that explains it. Because I find *Lost in Space* to be just about as bad. Well, Lost in Space kinda knows a little bit more what it wants to be -- but as it wants to be manufactured drama in front of a mystery box, I'm not tuning in.",scifi

All of his juvie novels are pretty good, and some of them rank among my favorites of all time.  *Spacesuit* and *Starman* are both great as you mentioned, as is *Farmer in the Sky*, *Red Planet, Tunnel in the Sky*, and *Citizen of the Galaxy*.",scifi
2922,"I really like the part in VR where they use Chinese soldiers as logic gates (so many others but that's one that stands out for me)

A lot is owed to Ken Liu's translation as well. From what I gather the Chinese original has a slightly different sequence of events. I also wonder if Ken got away with some details regarding the cultural revolution in the english version",scifi

2927,"I really, *really* enjoyed the series, especially the first and second books. Death's End is good, too, but I do think it lays the misery porn on a little thick at times. I'm all for things not going well for our heroes (A Song of Ice and Fire taught me well), but sometimes it feels more like the author fucking with us than something that makes sense in the context of the story. 

But despite those hangups, I think the series is GREAT. It was super ambitious and the author largely delivered.",scifi
2928,"Apples and oranges.

The first foundation series was a trilogy: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), Second Foundation (1953). At the end of Second Foundation, the story arc is finished.

Yes, he came back and did **more Foundation books** after publishing a bunch of other stuff - two sequels, Foundation's Edge (1981) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and two prequels: Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993)

This is not ***at all*** the same thing. For it to be the same, we would have had to have 30 years between Foundation and Empire, where the Mule is poised to expand his empire and subjugate the entire galaxy, and Second Foundation, the satisfying conclusion to the series. In fact, all three books were released within a 3 year span.",scifi

I will take a 2D death over that, if just to break the monotony of the cold, starless, future we are heading for.",scifi

2940,"OP should note that the Feist's books are kind of a series of series that don't necessitate reading them in order. Several books are basically standalone. That being said, definitely start with ""The Riftwar Saga"", *Magician: Apprentice*, *Magician: Master*, *Silverthorn*, and *A Darkness at Sethanon*.",scifi
2941,"Stop there, go and read his Robots books, and come back. In fact, many of Asimov's books are more connected than they appear at a glance. The End of Eternity, for example.

2942,"I listened to the Audiobook in German and found it interesting on some parts (especcially Book2) and boring in some others (most of Book 1 and the ending .... )

In german the names of the chinese are standing out extremely and I had a really hard time to recognize people by their names.   
The concept of the dark forest is a new one (at least for me) and I did find it intriguing but man I was happy when the whole ending finally was finished. This whole universe in a bubble thing/taking mass from the rest of the universe was absolute crap and I couldn't wait until it was finished.

But in retrospect, I would say I have read way worse scifi and also a lot better ones.",scifi
2943,"It's hard to explain without spoiling things, but complexity isn't the issue. The story is incredibly complex, and I agree with u/squidjuggler, it's one of the best scifi stories I have ever read. The way it plays with how we conceptualize language and communication is masterful.",scifi
2944,"Kingkiller has 2 novels and one novella and may never be finished but it's beautiful writing and a great story so I definitely recommend if you can give up hope on a 3rd.

Right now Sanderson's Stormlight Archive is where the big action is at. Great characters, a great world, hard magic system, and a story that could really go anywhere. 

Not enough people have read the Broken Earth trilogy by NK Jemesin. It borders both genres, and is some of the best books I've read in years.",scifi

2949,"Mieville can be over the top at times, that is sort of his trademark, but his worlds are entirely believable. Most of his work is a type of urban fantasy but Embassytown is straight science fiction. The twin-thing is not a big part of the story it just helps us understand similes. 

The description of these aliens' language is just mind-blowing. Mieville doesn't just say ""the language was totally different"" but rather he enables us to understand the structure of the language and how language shapes a species. Linguistics is sort of the motif or maybe the theme of the novel - it takes center stage.",scifi

Really poor 1-d characters, a plot that makes no sense, a ""video game"" that is completely unplayable or logical, bad dialogue, an alien society that makes no physical sense, terrible character interaction...it's just so bad. Sure, some of the ideas are neat, but at the expense of literally everything else that makes a book enjoyable.",scifi

2982,"I've read some of the series mentioned here and now I'm on the fifth book of malazan books of the fallen. It's great in my opinion and while there are too many books out there to trudge through one you don't like, I would say to really try to get through the first book. I feel that the complexity of the world in malazan makes me feel more immersed. It's okay that you don't memorize every name, location, and map. The ones that interest you will stick.",scifi
2983,"Kingkiller chronicles were 2 of the best books Ive read in a really really long time.  Its a shame that you decided to not bother based on one persons random comment.  Read  to read - not for some kind of perceived investment or wasted effort? You're here asking for recommendations because you're looking for good books to add to your list :)  

The concept of that ""trilogy"" being unfinished is silly.  Was the 2nd book not as good as the first? Depends I guess.  Either way I really enjoyed reading both back to back and my life doesn't feel unfinished as a result of knowing that theres likely never going to be a third or more (as sad as that may be to accept) ;)",scifi

Most things by L.E. Modesitt, though to be honest some of the books in the latter stages of ""The Saga of Recluse"" seemed repetitive to me.

2997,"Seconded. Rothfuss's gotten himself caught in a writer's trap. His first two were so well received that he can't publish the third one until he considers it perfect, or it will tarnish his previous work. Since nothing can ever be perfect, he won't ever publish it.",scifi
2998,The short story it's based on is worth a read in its own right.,scifi
2999,"Iain M Banks - start with Use of Weapons, then if you like it go from Consider Phlebas. 

Joe Abercrombie - start with The First Law. 

William Gibson - start with his second last, The Peripheral.  If you like his style, go from Neuromancer!

I don’t really want to spoil it for you, but only when you reach the end do you realize that there’s been something insidious going on the entire time, some corruption coming out of Area X and infecting the real world, and whatever control Control thought they had over things was always an illusion.

1. *The Many-Colored Land*  
2. *The Golden Torc*  
3. *The Nonborn King*  
4. *The Adversary*
5. *Intervention* (sometimes two books: *Surveillance* and *Metaconcert*)  
6. *Jack the Bodiless*  
7. *Diamond Mask*  
8. *Magnificat*

The detail in the universe she created is amazing. It is all about humanity learning to cope with mental powers and aliens. There is a lot more, but I don’t want to spoil the party.

3047,"It depends on what you like about those authors.  Epic certainly seems to be the common denominator.

If that's what you're looking for, I would recommend you check out the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan.  It was conceived and plotted completely by him, and he wrote 11 books and a prequel before his untimely death in 2007.  Brandon Sanderson finished the final three volumes based on his notes.  The fan response to the end has been overwhelmingly positive.

Jordan was a master of foreshadowing.  He put hints and clues even in the first book, The Eye of the World, that play out both at the end of that first book, as well as others that play out throughout the rest of the story and the end.

The story is what I consider to be the last great Hero's Journey of classic fantasy before the modern era.  It and Song of Ice and Fire marked a watershed in the 90s in what kind of fantasy was published.  The story is generally about a young man who is told that he must unite the nations and become the savior of the world - but the cost of saving it will be his sanity and his life.  There are thousands of characters (literally, two thousand seven hundred and eighty-two characters), both major and minor.",scifi

The unresponsive alien monument that landed on Earth? It responded to pigeon coos.  Fucking pigeons.  As the ""military bitch lady"" shows up, in person, to fire the research on the spot, he plays fucking pigeon noises at the monument.  It responds...

And my favorite? During that emergency mission, the XO wants to do this risky plan to cut down travel times.  The captain claims it's too risky, so the XO immediately launches a mutiny.  Their very first disagreement, he launches a mutiny.  Why? She was putting the ""mission in danger"" by not ""putting the mission in danger."" So his response is to put the mission in even more danger, with a mutiny, so he can continue putting the mission in yet more danger, to keep the mission safe from danger.  My brain hurt just typing that out.  Predictably, this dangerous new plan he so desperately wanted to try goes tits up and forces a counter-mutiny. He's not punished, demoted, or even confined to his quarters for this.  He just gets returned to active duty.  He immediately tries to murder the captain.

3142,"&gt;Beaming to the Klingon homeworld direct from Earth - a technological discovery that would render space flight utterly redundant

It would also make Admiral Robocop's entire plan (and thus the entire plot of the movie) entirely redundant. So, you're convinced the Klingons are a threat and the Federation is too soft to be ready for them? Ok, putting aside that it's stupid to provoke them ***now*** after just having built one secret super-ship instead of, I don't know, being patient and keeping the production going until they start the war you expect so you have a whole fleet of your super-ships when the shit goes down instead of just one... did you not notice how that's no longer even an issue? You now have a device that can beam a human-sized object from your living room straight to the Klingon homeworld, and you know what's not much bigger than an average human? A photon torpedo. A matter-anti-matter warhead with a yield of 64.4 megatons, which is more powerful than the strongest thermonuclear device ever constructed by humans. A bomb that can easily wipe a major city completely off the map. Hello? Can you say change of plans?

Anyone with two brain cells to rub together (and not hampered by plot induced stupidity) would realize the potential of that device immediately. They're small, so they are almost certainly easy to manufacture, and they are the perfect weapon. All you need is one for each major city and military facility on the Klingon homeworld, and then with the press of a button you can send them all across space instantly and without any warning to obliterate them all. No starships needed, no chance of failure, press a button and your enemy is bombed back to the stone age. You can do it from your living room couch.

With that capability, you can annihilate them now, or wait until they begin the attack you're expecting and do it then, or you can even take a third path and kill two birds with one stone. Send one to the coordinates Khanberbatch transported to, and the big boom sends him to hell and eliminates him as a problem. Then you signal the Klingons that you are responsible for the explosion, and that you are capable of doing the same to any or all of their cities and military bases any time. Don't tell them how, just that you can. And that if they don't leave you and yours the hell alone, you will. Then just crack open a cold one, put your feet up on the desk, and relax. Mission accomplished.

Or, you could continue to engage in your original convoluted, nonsensical plan and get your head crushed by Khanberbatch and your secret super-ship captured and destroyed. Whatever works for you, I guess.",scifi

I know this is blasphemy but I was ok with a more violent star trek because I found utopia of the older versions ""just informed"" and in a jarring contradiction to the humans who still behave like current day humans. In the end I read Discovery as a purely character driven story with plot elements from the old star treks (time travel, parallel universes...). 

I think Discovery got a lot more criticism (but also a lot more viewer) due to the branding. I think even without the branding Discovery wouldn't just drown on netflix.

I enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek. It's stylish, it's entertaining. It's not in the spirit of Star Trek, but whatever. I am all on board for cool starships doing cool starship things. Nobody needs to be quoting Shakespeare all the time.

But Discovery was trying so hard to be ""deep"", it's like watching a philosophy sophomore trying to impress his date. And then it *also* had to be dark. And it *also also* had to constantly prove that it is not your grandfather's Star Trek. *Also also also* that it ""respects the canon"" by constantly referencing it.

If Discovery were a person, it'd be what we call a ""try hard"". And nobody likes a try hard, even if he keeps quoting your favourite franchise to show that he ""gets"" you. *Especially* when he does that.

That means that from your viewpoint, you travel 10 times faster, you perceive 1/10th of gravity as normal gravity and so on.

The aliens are blind, using sound as their main way of interacting with the world. This poses an interesting problem for communication, because a lot of how humans define and identify themselves and others are by colors and visual patterns, and, famously, we're pretty shit at auditory communication when entirely submerged underwater. Plus, the blind aliens more closely resemble 18th century humans as far as technology level goes, so there is just a lot of communication barriers and aspects of life that one side appreciates that the other does not that is very interesting.

I do not think so in the least. Just because he made a massive fantasy world doesn't mean he's a great writer. Big difference and being able to differentiate is critical.

Herbert is an equally brilliant man. Perhaps more in that his world building came after years of study in the subjects to give him a very well versed background in many sciences. He's also a damn fine writer. DUNE gets a lot of attention but many, if not all, of his novels are incredibly good reads. White Plague would be a very timely book to pick up right now. The Void series is a fantastic study of many schools of thought in philosophy. (I feel more so than the DUNE series.) Hellstrom's Hive is a great scifi thriller.

If you take a look at what is shown/said on Picard, and what should have been the results/consequences of that, it's like a completely different universe. The worldbuilding of modern Star Trek is in utter ruins. A dumpster fire is better developed than this mess.

Some examples (obviously spoilers!):

* The decision made by the Federation's legislative branch of government to just let almost one billion people die because of a (at least at that point and to public knowledge) completely unrelated terrorist attack should have sent the general public into an unprecedented uproar. → What actually happened: apparently nobody besides ""JL"" gave a single flying fuck about it. No noteworthy protests or demonstrations, no political fallout, no rioting, nada.
* Giving Borg an even more advanced version of the Sikarian Trajector than what was shown in Voyager should have sent the Borg on an assimilation spree across the galaxy, because they literally have a virus that can convert whole planets (Voyager episode ""Dark Frontier""). → What actually happened: the Borg sat on both technologies for decades without doing anything. Let me say it again: the Borg refused to use technology that would allow them to assimilate whole planets from 40,000 lightyears away.
* Given that the Romulans are a cunning and resourceful species with access to highly advanced technology, the refugee camp on Vashti should have at least seen beginnings of development into a self-sufficient colony. → What actually happened: the Romulans sat on their asses for a decade, built a distillery, built a West World like shantytown, and got drunk.

It relies a lot on worldbuilding but it's not a worldbuilder's dream like LotR, which Tolkien admittedly created in painstaking detail as a means to further the development of his constructed languages and because it was irresistible. Dune suggests a lot more than it describes, which might be better for you if you became bored with LotR, or end up being frustrating. With LotR, Tolkien attempted to fashion a mythology, a whole cosmos; Dune relies a lot on mythological allusions and the power of mythology, but its characters treat it in a realistic way, as a political tool even while they're immersed in it. Dune is and reads like modern literature; LotR reads like archaic (although it's of course the work of a 20th century man).

Chemical firearms(gunpowder) essentially require a ""seal"" between the sides of the bullet and the barrel, otherwise the expanding gas will just leak out around the edges and the bullet will have much less power if it is even driven out at all.  This means that a bullet is almost the exact same size as the tube it travels through with very little space between.

3473,"Science fiction is just a further extrapolation of reality imho, so I think that genre writers don’t need to be necessarily hired.

3474,"I think a huge issue with scifi in general is that it's difficult to make a film/show that can provide the same depth/complexity as a book. When it comes to portraying complex ideas or simply providing food for thought, a book is still the superior medium as it allows you to pause and ponder, digesting the content in a very different way - compared to moving images that are supposed to grab your attention for 30-60 minutes at a time.

It's a real challenge (imho) to create something that isn't just an audio book with moving pictures. The nature of the film/show format itself requires interaction with characters and their environment to explain the themes one is about to explore and this dependence often tends to result in a lot more inter-character drama over time, up to a point where scifi becomes the backdrop.

The film/TV format is mostly a distillate of a much more complex and elaborate medium, and it's almost impossible to avoid simplifications in order to create a more easily digestible experience. And it's not just because of the viewers that depth is being sacrificed, but also because of time constraints and other limitations that are intrinsic characteristics of film/TV as a medium.

Being a very good writer/producer is just one part of this challenge.",scifi

In the pilot Mikey Spock is introduced as the Vulcan's Vulcan. Raised on Vulcan, the only ever human graduate of the Vulcan Science Academy; she has internalize the Vulcan discipline of stoicism, and has mastered the cold, calculating logic that they use to keep their boiling emotions under tight control.


Mikey then:

* Receives secret information on why Klingons are blowing off the Federation (instantaneous space telepathy? WTF?)

* Fails to present any kind of logical case to her captain and mentor

* Mutinies

* For the specific purpose of starting a shooting war with the Klingons

* Fucks up her shitty plan! WTF? How is a Vulcan so piss poor at taking control of a ship?

* Comes up with a better plan to capture the Klingon leader / prophet

* The Captain and the mutineer go on a tactical mission (no marines?)

* Mikey fucks it up and gets her captain killed; then in a fit of rage executed prophet, which she knew would start a war of extermination

To sum up; Mikey woke up in the morning and made a to-do list of ever single way she could betray the ethos and moral center of the Vulcans, then checked it off one by one.

If she had set out to start a war to kill millions or tens of millions of humans, she could not have done a better job.

In the pilot the producers of the show make it crystal clear that they knew exact what Vulcans stand for, and that they are going crap on those values in front of us; because: ""Fuck You""

Or, alternatively, the writers were so clueless as to the conflicting ethos of the Klingons and Vulcans, that this was their best effort to write Star Trek.

Which is worse?

The core premise of the show, the central character, who is better and smarter than everyone else is built on betrayal of her mentor and desperate, unfathomable incompetence.

And for the love of Spock, let's not worry about what happens to Pike, why? Because he knows, we know, and it won't happen until way after Kirk is already Captain of the Enterprise. (Re-watch [The Menagerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menagerie_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)), Enterprise did not know of Pike's accident until Starbase 11 communication, and after Kirk and Spock see him on the episode.)

They passed themselves off as protectors who would come only if a newer synthetic life was under threat and contacted them for help. Their ""beacon"" was a message/warning for synthetic life that their creators would naturally turn on them and how to summon them if the time came.!&lt;

&gt;!The romulans managed to interpret parts of this message that not meant which drove a bunch of them crazy.

Interestingly, it seems to be mostly in the old anthology shows where you find more involvement from actual scifi writers (or better attempts to adapt their stories). The Outer Limits had Harlan Ellison and Clifford Simak, Out of the Unknown used Isaac Asimov and Frederick Pohl, The Twilight Zone used Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, C.L. Moore, etc. You get the idea. 

Sure, some modern scifi series are based on the singular works of scifi authors, but they rarely include any deep involvement from the authors themselves. And I can't think of any modern scifi TV shows that went out of their way to hire previously established authors to actually write the majority of their material. Most use Hollywood screenwriters to ""adapt"" their material for the screen.

There's only so much you can put on the screenwriter. TV and film are a collaborative process, hundreds of people working together to assemble a finished product. Saying you can guarantee the success of a production based solely on writing is incredibly reductive. 

That said, the folks at the top (showrunners/producers) have the most influence over the entire production. In this case I have very little confidence they will put out a show that I will want to watch. I gave them the benefit of the doubt with Discovery and Picard and I really hated both shows. That's it I'm done with this generation of Star Trek. Better luck in 20 years I guess.",scifi
3540,"&gt; That way you will definitely have a good show. Guaranteed.

No matter who's writing it they're still gonna get boxed in because it's a prequel. You can't use anything that was introduced later, and you can't introduce anything that you can't explain why it's never mentioned later. You can throw canon to the wind, but then what's the point of doing a prequel?

Enterprise and Discovery both suffered these problems and handled them less than gracefully IMHO. Discovery in particular would have been a better show if they'd just set it post-Voyager rather than pre-TOS.

Picard was far from perfect but at least it was able to take the universe in interesting new directions worth exploring.

For a franchise that's built on optimism and human progress the folks in charge seem deathly afraid of taking it in the direction of letting it actually progress. Instead, they're weirdly hell-bent on mining it for nostalgia - the opposite of what Star Trek is about.

In Enterprise there was the episode where Flox found out that the planet they were currently at was inhabitated by two intelligent humanoid species. the dominant suffering from a degrading gene defect the secondary one at the at the verge of an evolutionary jump. The conflict (should we heal the currently suffering or allow evolution to go it's way?) was more star trek than anything in discovery (despite a complete misunderstanding of evolution). 

I believe to bring star trek to its heights again  you don't need a great writer, who writes interesting characters and coherent stories, but an average writer who can write star trek and is not afraid to show interesting view points to current topics.

Here are some highlights from a youtube comment on the announcement of Strange New Worlds video. The person who wrote that edited some of this out while I was responding, but I was so blown away by it I copied it to a Google Doc before I started to reply. It's insane. 

&gt;   For example, the captain on Discovery committed Treason.  On Picard, there are no male star fleet officers except for the one who was vivisected.   The last two Star Treks destroyed the franchise and turned it into a monument to America's decade of sex discrimination in the job market that led to half a million suicides among white males in what they call a 'mancession'.

&gt;Modern trek is anti-white-male pablum for ruthless and ambitious women.  Except it isn't, because the futures run by all those women are dystopian compared to their predecessors.  So the only losers are the people watching it, and the white men who want jobs where skills,  intelligence, or respect mean anything, and the male children of those fathers.  The girl children can just watch Star Trek and know brother's screwed for life and sister can do whatever she wants in the future because its female.    
&gt;

My headcanon says that the Great Houses didn't unify nearly as much as Discovery would have us believe, and that it was more of a centralized military but a divided empire until after the Gowron/Duras civil war, and so in early TNG, the captains we see, while serving in a united military, are from these old-school distrustful houses and wouldn't have shed any tears if the peace treaty fell apart.

Have at least one planet explode

Have a character that fights like a ninja seemingly out of nowhere

Have a couple of side plots go nowhere at all

Have random swearing to make it feel edgy and contemporary

Have endless nods and winks at the fandom essentially saying ""Hey remember this thing from this thing you like... We remember it too"" and they'll get it wrong.

Have a finale with two fleets of millions of cut and paste ships face off against millions of cut and paste ships... Perhaps spiced up with a third party getting involved mid way through. 

I mean between the Kelvin-Verse films, Discovery and Picard its literally a word template you can fill in yourself nowadays. 

And I have to say from a personal viewpoint as a long lapsed fan of Trek who keeps hoping it will return to form; it seems to me that for a show that was about optimism, the celebration of science, exploration, pursuit of knowledge and looking towards a bright future, Trek has got progressively more dumb, dark and backward looking. 

So yeah its nice lip service saying they have scifi writers on staff now, but frankly they should have had that from the start of this whole TV resurgence and I'm firmly in the believe it when I see it mode now after ~~Mass Effect rip off~~  \*ahem\* I mean Picard which had the same ""we're not Discovery, we're going back to thoughtful Trek"" soundbites up until Admirals started swearing, Mars exploded, androids started ninja kicking Romulans about and after a few cameos and dead end B plots we had a thousand Star Fleet vessels face down a thousand Romulan ships, some space flowers and ~~non copyright infringing Reapers~~ I mean artificial life that cycles around every 10000 years to harvest / wipe out organic life...

every serieses new captain is trash, 
 and every new series isn't as good as ""my"" star trek or ""real"" star trek because bleh. 

I'm all for healthy discourse and some fun light ribbing between series fan bases but the infighting and hostility is turning the entire fan base toxic.

3862,"I really love ST. People complain so much that this isn't the Piccard that they know and completely ignore that people change over time.

Also, I want my ST to touch on current issues. That might not be what made ST great, but it's what kept ST relevant during the last 50 years.

Honestly, if the internet would have been a thing during TNGs premiere, it would have been trashed so hard during S1 that a S2 probably wouldn't have happened.

[Having said that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHVQ2gslp8), there's an issue with having a serialised ST show. If you didn't like the overall plot, then you won't like the show in general. I haven't rewatched any episodes of Piccard or DISCO since they aired, because there are barely any episodes that can stand on their own. I think this is the main problem with the new shows, but modern (streaming) TV kind of demands a serialised structure, since you want to keep viewers hooked. DS9 had a very serialised plot in the later seasons, but it worked because they had a lot of time building up to it.

So I don't really know what the solution is here. And of course, ST is special and you'll always piss off some fans. For me, DS9 is still the show that aged best because of its overarching plot, but it's probably hard to convince studio execs to do a few seasons of (mostly) standalones first. On the other hand, I really wished for a a well written serialised ST show - there's so many great serialised shows on TV right now and I'm sad that ST isn't among them.",scifi

(Laumer actually worked for the State Dept during the Korean War, and has hinted at least some of Retief's adventures were inspired by real-life diplomatic antics.)

Also not entirely spycraft, but WASP by Eric Frank Russell also comes to mind.  It's about a special agent in an intergalactic war sent to an enemy planet, to use psychological warfare and insurrectionist tactics to destabilize the government.

I still believe it contributed a lot to the longevity of ST. It was really meaningful for me to grow up watching a female captain, as a little nerdy girl. I also always liked the Holodeck episodes a lot. I know TNG had some as well. 

Kudos for watching all the series and pushing through Voyager even if it wasn't your cup of tea.

I literally finally pushed through Voyager today.  I'm trying to do all Trek.  I loved DS9 and had high hope's for Voyager but it sucked soooooooo bad.  There are exactly two interesting characters on the show, The Dr and Seven and you dont even get Seven still season 4.  

The rest of the cast is just so boring.  Janeway should have been good but her characterization is all over the map depending on each episodes plot making her frustrating. Everyone else has basically a single personality point and that's what you get each episode. 

Then the utter wasted potential of the show.  Such a great premise - two hostile crews trapped across the galaxy and who must work together to get home.   The show rarely touched on this and you would have no clue half the crew were Maquis in the vast majority of episodes.

Then the stupid writing.  The ship is racing home yet in season 6 a character from season 2 that was left behind catches up to them in a shuttle in days despite all the distance Voyager supposedly covered.  This works on a show like TNG but not Voyager but then the writers basically were just writing TNG 2.0.   So many instances of this kind of nonsensical writing. This show could have been what the Battlestar Galactica reboot was where they showed what it would actually be like to be a ship alone and a crew stressed beyond belief.   Instead we got a poor version of TNG.

Then the finale episode.  DS9 had a great finale as it wrapped up all the dangling plots and then devoted the last half hour to basically be an extended goodbye.  Voyager climaxes with about a minute left and then just ends.  You know they made it home but you dont see it. Even though I really didnt like the cast I still would have liked to have seen how the Maquis were accepted, how the Dr was accepted, Harry seeing his parents, Paris seeing his dad, etc.",scifi

In the first sentence, I stopped at the word ""overwhelm"" because the definition and use in the sentence didn't match well.  Maybe easier to read: ""The lower west sector was overwhelmed by..."" or ""Tattered clothes and endless voices overwhelmed the lower west sector as the citizens of Terra waited for the ambassador's announcement.""

Defining a display brand in a short story may not add the feel I think you are going for. Minimize descriptions and use powerful words instead.

I don't think the use of a parenthetical description is great in the middle of a quote. ""... from POD..."" should be left as is, and explain it later if you want. 

Try reading the sentences aloud, and see how they roll off the tongue.

Watch capitalization - most words don't deserve it. Try to use simple past tense verbs instead of past perfect with helping verb had. It is much easier to read ""Your mother and I spent years...""  than ""Your mother and I had spent years...""

Your writing suggests that you have a good feel for drawing the reader in - use that sense and pare it down until you get that feeling in every single sentence.

As anyone will tell you - write and read regularly. Notice what you like in the written word - this will impact what you end up with if you allow yourself the needed iterations to tune it in after initial writing.

I don't like the planned, intentional plot, but the organic creative approach. There is a huge creative element in human brains to tap here. I suggest you start with something: a phrase, memory, picture, passionate experience and let that lead the first words in your story. Invite your creative brain/soul (whatever it is) to take the next steps, asking - what is this about, where is this going? Maybe there will be false starts. So what. In the end you will have something sweet like a part of yourself you cherish, and even if nobody else loves it, you certainly will.

4200,This stuff has become physically painful for me to watch. But I'm more scared about when the pain stops because that means I fully don't care about Star Trek anymore. I don't want to see this happen to something I love but CBS is determined to get there at break-neck speed.,scifi

4207,that's probably a good decision,scifi
4208,"Star Trek has never worked in the movie format. because movies need to be big explosions and set-pieces and Star Trek never really been about that. That's as been true of TOS movies as well, but the TNG movies were fine for what they were.

As for TV, Enterprise was fine, I know it got some hate but that was mostly for the kind of crap writing that some episodes had. Archer always did whatever the most stupid thing in any given situation was.

The issue fans had with Discovery was that it just ignored everything that had come before, and went in its own direction even though that made absolutely no in the universe sence. That wouldn't have been so much of an issue if the writing had been on point and the characters had been likable, but since it wasn't, and they weren't (for the most part), fans panned it. It also didn't help that the show runners were so dismissive of complaints.",scifi

4212,Have the fans liked any star trek series or movie since DS9?,scifi
4213,"The only people who think that are people don't bother to understand fans complaints. Like, which of these two scenarios is more likely, that fans arbitrarily decided to dislike one particular series of Star Trek? Or that they don't like it when you randomly mess around with canon for no apparently good reason and make awful characters?

All fans want is for them to respect the shows that have come before, that's it, that's not asking much.  Don't try to turn it into something else, if you want to make something else that's fine, but don't just stick a Star Trek label on it just as a marketing gimmick.",scifi
4214,And yet here you are wasting time talking about a show that you won’t watch.,scifi
4215,Can also confirm that is a fuciking awesome book.,scifi
4216,Orson Scott Card’s Speaker for the Dead takes a long hard look at the concept of different degrees of alienness. It made me think a bit.,scifi

4218,"Covid has abnormal coagulation (makes blood clot) and has the ability to invade and attack the cells in your heart, myocardial cells.  You could have had both.  

Note that a heart attack is still a low probability from a mild case of covid (it sounds like you weren't hospitalized or in the ICU).  However, when covid invades the heart, it causes inflammation there which will make you feel like you are having a heart attack and your labs and even an ECG could also indicate towards a heart attack.  The difference is there is no blockage in the heart and so there is no ischemia or lack of oxygen in the heart cells so the heart will recover with likely no lasting damage to it.

Now I said likely no lasting damage as, like you mentioned, covid-19 is so new we knew nothing about it when things started to unfold in China in December 2019 (that's where the 19 in covid-19 comes from btw).  Even now, we know so little about covid-19 that we haven't been able to establish a gold standard of care.  Combine this with limited testing, symptoms not showing until a couple days AFTER an infected person has peaked in their viral count and are most contagious, and no vaccine, this is why social distancing and good hygiene is so important.

Source: I'm reading journals daily and being updated daily from work.  I work in the ICU as a nurse.  Covid-19 patients in the ICU are so so sick.

Hope this helps you understand a little bit of maybe what was going on when you were sick (this is really different and scary for all of us).  Glad to hear you recovered well from it.  I'm going to have to make the change to Spotify and listen to your Sci-fi podcast.",scifi

I'm also very partial to Didem from *Colony*, being both familiar enough to seem almost human but with just enough alien uniqueness to feel not quite there, and occupying a very unique and powerful position in the setting.",scifi

I loved his taunts.",scifi
4227,"Yeah, it's very much a hybrid. Hamilton loves to mix formulas and even genres in his later novels - and I can understand why it's not everyones cup of tea.

The Greg Mandel series is his earliest work though, and stays more grounded.",scifi
4228,A suggestion from me would be the The Algebraist by Iain M Banks. The Dwellers exist in gas giants and perceive time in a very different fashion to ourselves. A good read. 👍,scifi

The Martian is fantastic and very much reality based and close to us in time.  
Leviathan wakes (expanse) is an engaging read as well that is more focused on people and politics in a nearer future space setting.   

My favorite is Speaker for the Dead by Card. You need to read Enders Game first which is quick and almost YA in tone. Its child geniuses in school doing war games. Speaker is entirely different and reads almost like a psychological procedural tv show.

It's based in a rundown lab in an alternate universe where technology allows 'trained professionals' to visit each others dreams (purely in the name of science you understand!). Seems similar to this where the rotoscoping kicks in for the dream sequences (and boy oh boy does it make use of that freedom of expression).

Now with access to the Borg transwarp conduit network and further development of technology, time travel, etc. - eventually the Federation is going to either a) have to expand to protect all 'free peoples' of the galaxy, b) go to war with another power unwilling to cooperate with them, or c) fail in doing either of the above and 'fall' to said opposition.

Keeping Trek couched in the 'expansion and exploration' era of TOS means that you can continue to tell stories about *the unkown*, i.e. ""wild west in space"".  After DS9 we know what's going on in the Gamma quadrant, and after Voyager we know what's going on in the Delta quadrant.  The rest would just be filling in the gaps.",scifi

Also interesting nice to see a sci-fi(?) show where the main character is a female PoC, which isn't exactly a common thing at all.

A season 2 is interesting, but I'm worried they'll fuck up what was a really good (if ambiguous) ending to a show which walked the line between sci-fi and metal illness with exquisite delicacy and *even at the end* never quite explicitly came down on either side.

4510,"This is the saddest thing to me, because back in the mid 60s they took a big chance coming out with the original Star Trek show. There wasn't much on TV other than Westerns and Detective shows. Sci-Fi wasn't even really a genre on TV. They wanted to make something new and bold. They wanted to have futuristic concepts such as interracial relationships, women in powerful positions and science and peaceful diplomatic handling of situations. They added in a bit of that Western action with some phaser blasts and good ol' fist fights and they had an instant hit on their hands.

Now, over half a century later, our studio executives can't be bothered to take that same chance. Instead they just keep rehashing the same ol thing, hoping the super-fans will keep the franchise afloat based solely on nostalgia. And sadly they do most of the time.

Nostalgia in the 1600s -1700s used to be looked upon as a sickness. Something that people longed for, home and familiarity... which impeded on growth and drive. A need to move forward and experience new things, to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man had gone before.

At the end of the movie he's left with thousands of human embryos as hosts to experiment with. And the ship is headed to an empty  planet ready for human colonisation.

&amp;#x200B;

It'll be released across all digital stores and a review from where you normally buy would be extremely helpful.

If you're interested, let me know here and I'll send you a link.

Here's the blurb...

The ARvekt is in you. In your brain. Wetware, grown in from birth.
You are connected. To everything. All the time. To the Augmented Reality that surrounds you. Life is a sonic, tactile and visual wonder. Better than the real ever could be.

But what if reality isn't real?

Ix is your Guardian AI. It protects you. Keeps you safe.
From war. From illness. From rogue AIs.
It has saved us so many times. Ix, Guardian AI, saviour of humanity.

But what if its protection is really betrayal?

Section-R. Shadow agency. Wage an underground war against brain hackers. Use temporal instances of Augmented Reality to infiltrate and rescue victims like you. The hackers want your mind. Your data. Your secrets. 

But what if the public knew about the hackers?

Tannis Ord. Section-R Agent. Infiltration and extraction specialist.
A psychotic event left her partner dead. Dead by her own hands. Traumatised, her mind was in tatters. Now it has been repaired. She's ready to return back to duty.

But what if she isn't ready? What if her mind isn't repaired? What if the psychosis has returned?

So when Tannis investigates a mind hack like no other, it leads her to question everything. About Ix. About Section-R. About herself. 

If reality isn't real, is it illusion? Or her own delusion?",scifi

That said, while xenomorphs take traits from their hosts, the xenomorph part is always dominant. They're clearly intelligent and problem-solving in all of their incarnations but they never cease to be incredibly hostile to other lifeforms. They're intelligent but they're not human, they don't think like humans.

In Alien, Ash describes it as: 

&gt;You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.  
&gt;  
&gt;I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.

You know, that only makes it a 'success' to the people that get those dollars. If you're a TV watcher, spending money on a show you didn't like might not be considered a success. 

But, very well, if 'success' is merely based on how many bucks a thing could make, then Classic Trek is doing great because it's ALSO a critical success, and people keep watching the old movies and shows over and over because they are generally received as GOOD. 

So even if the new shows make money now - and that's impossible to tell because CBS doesn't report numbers - if it's not critically adored, absolutely nobody will be watching this shit in a decade's time, much less 50+ years later as still occurs with TOS.

But also, his actual words:
&gt;""...but the most damning thing of all, is I think I can live with it. If I had to do it all over again, I would.""

Not only can he live with it, he would do it again with eyes wide open, and he says this very much without hesitation.

There is a moral struggle going on here, but it isn't Sisko holding his head wondering what he has become and how he could fall so far to be driven to such terrible deeds.  This is Sisko realizing that he is okay with what he just did, and finding that fact more disturbing than anything else.  That is why he calls the fact he would do it all over again even if he had not been ignorant ""damning"".

&gt;If this new series keeps people paying for CBS all access, then it is a success, no matter who has the reigns. 

Aside from this being a super cynical and creatively bankrupt measure of 'success', it has zero bearing on whether something is actually **good.** Vapid 'reality' shows like Pawn Stars keep networks afloat, and it's your manner of thinking that propelled execs to rename the Sci-Fi Channel to SyFy and show professional wrestling and cancel original sci-fi shows. 

A lot of boring people watch vapid, stupid shit. That doesn't make it good, even if it is 'successful' to some degree. CBS doesn't release their streaming numbers, so far all we know they're actually tanking right now.

The *only* thing he is a little disturbed about is the fact that he doesn't feel bad.  Sisko is a good Federation man in his head, and that scene is Sisko realizing how much his heart and mind are at odds.  He knows he should feel bad for the fraud, lying, and killing that he just participated in, but Sisko finds his heart doesn't have any problem doing a dirty deed to win.  He isn't doesn't even let himself off the moral hook because he was trick.  He'd confronts himself with the fact that he would do it again with eyes wide open and fully apart of Garak's scheme if he had the chance to do it all over again, and he'd be okay with it.  That's why he finds his feelings ""damning"".  He knows in his head how he should feel, but he doesn't feel that way.

Sisko is Mongolian raider, a Klingon warrior, or Tal Shiar agent stuffed into the body of a Federation man, and in that episode, he realizes that.  Sisko isn't a bad guy for liking to fight and win, because he does it in the service of something good.  If anything, Sisko is the best of the Federation *because* his nature is competitive, cunning, and ruthless, and yet instead of channeling those things to destructive ends, they are used for the greater good to be a master diplomat and martial defend of the Federation.",scifi

&gt;Regardless, doesn’t really matter to me. Kirk was at the center of everything in TOS. Picard was generally at the center of TNG. Janeway was generally the center of VOY. 


Disagree. They were the 'center' in the sense that they were the Captains and had to make decisions, but aside from 'special' episodes the dilemma of the week was very rarely 'personal' to them.

I won't get into arguments about these things, even if I disagree, but what classic Trek had was good *storytelling*, which is the most important thing in any production. You can forgive a lot if the story and characters are good.

Sisko made a few 'indiscretions' but he wouldnt have chosen to do all the things that were done, but once they were done, he didn't have a choice but to keep quiet about it, for the sake of the quadrant. 

At the end, when he says 'he can live with that', it's pretty crystal clear that this is something he's trying to convince himself of, and he's obviously not cool with it.

They could have salvaged him by having him be changed by his experience in the Prime Universe - he grew a conscience and became somewhat 'good', and thus complex and interesting. Like maybe he still wanted to return home and overthrow the Empress, but had ideas of implementing a sort of democracy or Starfleet style arrangement rather than being Emperor himself. But no, he was simply reduced to mustache twirling villain, as you said. 

In the end the whole season was just a mess. It was about a war, and then switched to the mirror universe for the second half of the season, and brought back the war in the final two episodes to clumsily try to wrap it all up. 

I made it two episodes into the second season, but I bailed because I couldn't bear to see my boy Spock, who was a legit childhood fictional role model for me, be butchered.

Have you read *World of Ptaavs*? If not, then beware - there are spoilers below...

The psi amplifier helmet was a crucial plot item in the **earlier** novel ""World of Ptaavs"". It was what Greenberg/Kzanol was searching for in the outer planets. It would have enabled him to **amplify** his psi powers to take over the entire solar system in one go.

In the much-later Man-Kzin wars novella - I think the story was called ""Hall of the Mountain King"" - it was the Tunctipun which was trying to obtain or build a psi-amplifier to escape Wunderland, and to take over the Kzin and the humans. 

So when you first mentioned ""going after the suicide amplifier"" I naturally assumed you were referring to the *first* novel where it was used as a plot device: ""The World of Ptaavs"".

4702,"I don't entirely disagree with you, I just think that struggle is going in the opposite direction much of the time.  Sisko head is that of a True Believer Federation man, but his heart is a bit closer to Klingon warrior (and his tactics are a bit closer to being Romulan).  He happily pounds backs with Klingon warriors and joins them on their raids.  True, it is out of necessity that he does these things, but he isn't exactly kicking and screaming trying to find a way out.  Picard would never look comfortable running a raid with a bunch of Klingons behind enemy lines, Sisko pretty clearly enjoys it.

In fact, I think a lot of DS9 is Sisko finding the space to Sisko.  DS9, in the middle of political intrigue, war, and general chaos and mayhem is where Sisko's skills really shine.  He walks the line between idealism and brutal pragmatism.  He is exactly the right man for the job, and he fills that role comfortably.  I don't think any Federation captain could have existed in that time and place and done better than Sisko.  

Personally, I think the end of A Pale Moon Light is Sisko, whose head is that of A True Believer Federation Man, finds his heart is okay with what he did.  He is disturbed, but he is disturbed by the fact he even as his head scolds him, his heart is okay with it.

Maybe that's the divergence point for the Mirror Universe?  Earth achieves warp drive after WWIII, but never makes contact with the Vulcans.  Some post-war faction gains control of warp technology, weaponizes it, and 100+ years later the Terran Empire starts burning across the galaxy.",scifi

2) They don't know how to build a hard sci-fi world that is consistent, so anytime the plot/information given does not make sense according to the established lore, or even with the events the series portrayed itself, the pace picks up.

To me, much of *Star Trek* involves characters sacrificing their happiness and even their lives to save others.

I think that *Sub Rosa* and *Threshold* are bad examples of *Star Trek*.  If someone said that they thought that they liked those episodes, I'm not going to butt in and tell them that they're wrong.  Everyone has an opinion, and maybe they have an insight that I don't.

On the flip side, *Masks* is my favorite episode of *The Next Generation*, and I think that it's a great example of *Star Trek*.  Many people do not.

The Price of the Phoenix and the sequel called The Fate of the Phoenix. Both are TOS novels, written a LONG time ago. They talk about how the Federation is really a decrepit organism that does not really hold all the values people seem to think it holds, and describes how one person can bring it all down.

Picard is going to take a calm principled, higher view on the situation and stand a bit aloof from his crew and be held in high regard.  Sisko is going shrug off the rules, pull out a pair of metaphorical knives, and hit you sideways when you don't expect it... and he will be grinning the entire time because he *loves* the fight, and he loves to win by any means necessary.  Pike is captain Good Guy Dad who is going to build a consensus while asking tough questions.

Better make sure we don't forget some bitch'n tunes.""

Seeing this, the vulcans made one of the smartest decisions in trek history and limited how quickly this planet of mad scientists developed.

For Christ's sake, the volucans had been exploring the galaxy for centuries. In all that time they determined that time travel was impossible. Yet once the humans got a hold of a decent warp drive it took them less than three years to somehow accidently yeet a starship back in time.

Agreed about security, the behavior on the ship is very unprofessional in general, but they're clearly not held to the same standards as NASA in our time. Likely a consequence of technological progress leading to complacency, along with privatization. Don't remember the liftoff.

I didn't know the show was cancelled, so I just watched it not knowing what to expect, and when I got to the end I was happy with it. Not amazed, but it was fine, the journey was what mattered. Like I said, the questions, what science/fiction is all about. Didn't think another season was needed, but I could see the possibility of one.

You don't think this reached the general audience, on Netflix? Or that anything futuristic/with a decent budget/adapted from GRRM books in [current year] would? How come I couldn't find the typical nerd stuff critic channels on YT reviewing it, or anyone? I fear it may have only reached the general audience.

I don't like horror either, unless it's in already interesting scifi, and this kept me interested (and it wasn't all that much horror either). But stupid characters aren't a bad thing by default, only if they're uncharacteristically stupid or if the writers made them stupid without understanding it. I haven't really experienced that here.

Streaming series run 8-13 episodes per season, usually focused on one or two major arcs.  ""Bingeable"" television with little time for side stories.  For a franchise like Star Trek, with its history and continuity, the short-form is very dissatisfying.  

My favorite episode of Picard was when he spent a day with Riker and Troi.  It made me so happy to see them living as a family.  And so much backstory and history was hinted at for them and their kids, but there was barely time to explore any of it.  It was a hook for a future spin-off.

Elnor could have been cut entirely with no impact on the story. The whole series so far has basically been about introducing new characters which don't matter and then shock value of bringing established characters into the story for limited screen time. It's lazy writing, last 3 episodes we're given a brand new character who ends up being the antagonist (as if that wasn't something we didn't see coming).

I can accept the idea that what he had in mind for Prometheus or Tomorrowland just didn't gel with what the other people involved wanted to go for.

And I love Fuller too, but I don't know what the hell is happening with him lately. It seems like everything he works on falls apart for one reason or another due to backstage drama. Hopefully this is all leading to a Hannibal revival.

I understand the reticence when it comes to Kurtzman and I'm in no way even trying to say he has the talent of a Fuller or a Lindelof but he has good shit on his resume just like he has bad shit, and all things considered I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

4897,"There's like no logic to what you're saying. They're good writers who have some bad projects on their resumes, not the other way around. Shit writers don't just magically come up with the occasional good script. It's much easier to explain how a project can turn to shit when, like I said, the process of making a movie or show involves way more people than just the initial writer. There are a lot of shit writers out there no doubt but it's rare for them to get into sustained positions of power in hollywood without having at least some talent. Shit writers don't win Oscars for their scripts, they don't create and write on a top tier show like Fringe for multiple seasons. 

Of course it's way easier to pick stuff that you don't like and think isn't good and point to the writing. The internet is a generally negative place and that's scapegoating 101.

I think guys like Goldsman and Kurtzman are just more comfortable taking hits on their resumes to work on IP they like. Like I explained, Batman &amp; Robin is a perfect example of that. A studio hires you to write a Batman movie, you do a generally good job so they want another one, but now they want it in half the time and you might not have a great idea for it, but you're under contract and on a deadline and you're also working on other projects you've moved on to. So you turn in a subpar script and it only proceeds to get further mangled when they cast the hot doctor from ER as the dark knight and a loud Austrian Mr. Universe as the usually subdued and troubled ice scientist. Of course it's going to go to shit. And I bet every one of those movies and episodes you hate have similar stories. But it's easier to just say the writer sucks.

There is literally an entire fleet of ships and and entire universe for them to explore. 

The USS Intrepid, USS Constellation, USS Exeter, and the USS Defiant are just a few in the original series aside from the Enterprise. They could make a show about any of those. And a few had the Captain go insane, that transition would make for a good story arc.

So sick of them trying to rehash the Enterprise and make it look more modern than it was than in the original series. You wanna make it look right, use the same sets and equipment from the original series. It's the storytelling that's crap, NOT the sets.",scifi
4939,"Just a thought here.  Authors take a bad rap for doing too much of what they call “exposition”.  Breaking down a simplified narrative for the reader that lays a foundation for interpreting the rest of the story.  From a creative standpoint exposition is considered a freshman technique for storytelling.  It limits the imagination of the reader and narrows interpretation down to the views that the author has created through the exposition.  I think Gibson is purposefully avoiding almost any exposition in Neuromancer as a creative tool that at one end will likely turn off readers that don’t feel comfortable making the imaginative leap required to engage with the story and  at the same time open the work for age enduring interpretations.  This is part of the reason Neuromancer is relevant today.  

My advice would be to keep plowing and let Gibson’s story speak to you as a whole and not get caught up in needing a proscribed narrative at each step of the journey.  It takes some discipline but IMHO Gibson pays it out by the end of the story.  Neuromancer is the foundation for so much of what we accept as given background for this genre.  He is an explorer in uncharted waters with this book, see his undiscovered country for what it is and perhaps the sense of wonder will grow as he describes his visions.",scifi
4940,"The opposite is true though. It's easy to pick out the Fringe and A Beautiful Mind.

But he gets so much shit because people hated the end of LOST and a couple of his movies. I think he's proven he wasn't completely at fault for those and that he's better than what might be his worst work.

As for Discovery, it's an odd show. Remember that it started as a Bryan Fuller show and he was fired during production on the first season (something that's happened several times since with him). Then they had to fire the next set of showrunners because they were abusing the writers. I think by the end of season 2 they finally got the show to where the current batch of writers wanted it and finally steered the ship into the right direction, it was just a bumpy road. But I think there's a lot of good in there. The cast and performances are really good, there are bright spots with some of the more self-contained sci fi stuff they've delved into (the Beta Quadrant town that go moved from earth, the Kelpian/Ba'ul drama, the stuff with the sphere, even the giant tardigrade stuff and how they treated the mycelial network).

It's easy to cherrypick from people's filmographies and focus on the bad. Writers tend to get a bad rap in this regard. If something fails it seems to me like the writers tend to get the most shit for it, but they're like the first step in the process and usually a movie or show doesn't get the go ahead without a good script. From there it's not that hard to fuck up a movie between studio notes, rewrites, punch-ups, filming, editing, post-production, etc. 

I'm not saying these two writers share no blame for why the movies you mentioned sucked but looking at all of the situations individually you could probably identify other factors. Like Batman &amp; Robin had a bunch of problems. It was fast-tracked after Batman Forever did well and Goldsman and Schumacker had to write it while they were already working on A Time To Kill. They also had bad casting thrust on them (Clooney and Arnold) and that didn't fit with what they were going for (a campy throwback to the 60s show). Just as an example.",scifi

They earn the trust and respect of a bunch of other species who can't bridge the gaps in their differences. Our ability to be flexible and empathize with all these various extremes creates a culture of sharing that allows us to eventually surpass them. It's not that implausible that a fledgling nation could be so neutral that it can take from all sides and eventually catch up to or even surpass ones that were ahead of it. 

The longer the Star Trek universe goes on we need to try and explain more and more the various reasons all these alien societies fit together despite so many of them being extreme to a fault. Vulcans with their obsession over logic and being unable to control their emotions. Klingons as technological vikings obsessed with death and glory. These were all shallow concepts ToS could get away with barely scratching the surface of. As time goes on, someone needs to try and give them all depth and it's no easy job. 

I honestly think Enterprise did an ok job at sort of showing how human ingenuity and our ability to adapt quickly helped us win favor and rise quickly. It was by no means a perfect show but I think it rose to the challenge of trying to give more explanation to the early days of human space exploration.",scifi
4969,"Enterprise showed us that the strength humans bring to the table is our diversity, which makes us more tolerant of -- and able to work with -- the diverse alien species out there. And humans used that unifying strength to bring together the more technologically advanced founding members of the federation. At no point in Enterprise were humans technologically superior to Vulcans. How we benefitted them was with the ""soft skills"" (and risk tolerance) that Vulcans notoriously lack.

Because humans are the unifying force of the federation, it makes sense that HQ would be on Earth, and that it would be staffed with many/mostly (local) humans. It also makes sense that ships whose primary mission is to ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" would be primarily human. As that is the mission of the flagship Enterprise, I can see why TOS would give off that impression (of human superiority). Remember, the Enterprise (once TOS put it in the federation instead of the United Earth) was built from Human AND Vulcan AND Andorian AND Tellarite (AND whoever else had joined by that point) technology. Humans didn't ""surpass"" anyone.

I'll finish with a non-canon argument I saw on reddit, which is that though we see mainly human ships on TV, there are just as many ships that are mostly Vulcan or mostly Andorian etc. Because each species has different biological requirements (temperature, humidity, air composition etc), it makes sense to cluster them on ships where everyone can be comfortable (and work optimally) on a given environmental control setting.",scifi

4990,"So I had this issue with Neuromancer when I first read it many years ago. On a reread, I have some thoughts. I’ll be brief as possible.

Yes, Gibson is playing a game of relatively literary style with a massive amount of cyberpunk world building mashed in there. It is frankly, hard to follow. Style and genre are mixing violently. If you look at, say, Snow Crash, the two are in harmony. I, as the reader, pay as little or as much attention to any detail as the narrator/POV character(s).

BUT (a big but, and I like big buts), on my reread I noted something very important that my massive experience with psychedelics between reads revealed. Case is broken, like badly broken, via a forced dose of supermushrooms. Despite the various things which mitigate this in the Neuromancer world, it is pervasive and effective.

So, yes, we get a choppy, disjointed narrative from a POV character who often seems fixated on the wrong things or lost in his own head—because he is. His brain has been systematically broken with drugs and is held together by glorified duct tape. Of course his story makes no sense.

So it’s either a brilliant stylist choice or yes, Gibson’s style is impenetrable for no reason. I can’t say for sure.",scifi

5030,"Mage - Generic magic user

Wizard- Usually magic user dealing with more elemental powers.  

Warlock - Magic user that gets powers at least partially from pacts with demons.

Magician - Person in RL that puts on magic shows at parties and in Vegas.  It honestly throws me when I see it used in a fantasy context.  

Sorcerer - Magic user that is incredibly powerful and probably deals with darker types of magic.

Witch - Female Warlock and/or magic user that specializes in positions and more natural magic.  

\-----------------

Some other ones for fun:

Arch Mage - Generic Magic User that has mastered a variety of magic types to a high level.  Very powerful/influential magic user.

Cleric - Magic user that has healing magic sometimes mixing it with up and personal combat to be a battle cleric.  Anti evil magic fighter.  

Priest - User power of divinity to bless/heal/fight demons.  

Nature Priest/priestess - User of nature magic for healing/blessing

Necromancer-  Fights using undead corpses raised from dead and curses.  

Cabalist- Create Golems with body parts of various creatures and uses them to fight.  

Thermatage - More of a magic researcher perhaps?  Only example I can really think of is in DAOC (dark age of camelot a mmo from 20 years ago) where they used mostly elementals to fight for them but not sure where that came from.  

Battle Mage -  Mage that uses magic to both combat at range and close in with melee weapons.  

Elementalist - Mage that specializes in Elemental Magic similar to wizard but in my mind less powerful.

Arcanist- Not sure honestly.

I'm going to disagree on this. Farming is just about the worst occupation a person could have.

There are so many things that can go wrong and worst of all if the year is too good and prices you might lose more then in a year when you produced nothing.

5087,"Not a lot of fantasy fare from France, sadly.

Of course, we have some *Asterix* adaptations. If you’re American maybe you don’t know Asterix, but it’s the best-selling comic book series in the rest of the world. It’s about Gaulish warriors fighting the Roman invasion with the help of a superstrength-granting magic potion. It’s a comedy done in a cartoony style, with a lot of clever puns and wordplays.  

The last two Asterix computer-animated movies are good (*The Mansion of the Gods* and *The Secret of the Magic Potion*). In fact, as a rule the animated adaptations generally are, the live action ones are not (don’t bother).

We do have one fantasy TV show, it's called *Kaamelott* and it’s very good. It's a comedy (at first, then it becomes a dramedy) about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Very funny and the creator of the show knows his fantasy stuff. At least the first seasons (out of six) were subtitled in English, but honestly I can't guarantee the series stays good watching it that way. Most of the humor comes from the dialogues and different slangs and would be a lot of work to translate correctly (a bit like Asterix).  

Not fantasy TV shows but of interest: *Nicolas Le Floch* (murder mysteries in the time of Louis XV), *Hero Corp* (superhero comedy), and *Le Visiteur du Futur* (time travel comedy, subtitled episodes are available on the series website).  

The historical novel series *The Accursed Kings* (Les Rois Maudits), famously one of G. R. R. Martin’s main inspirations for ASOIAF, was also adapted as an event series twice. The 1970s version is a classic, but can feel like a filmed play. The 2000s version has good actors, but they made the bizarre choice of asking famous SF comics author Druillet to design the interior sets, and only the interior sets, which can be a bit jarring.

The upcoming Netflix series *La Révolution* looks promising. It’s a fantasy horror reimagining of the French Revolution built around a mysterious blue blood.  

Movie-wise, we have a very good ""almost fantasy"" movie in *Brotherhood of the Wolf*. It's a stylized historical action horror movie about the infamous Beast of Gévaudan which killed hundreds of people during the 18th century. Not really fantasy, but the spirit is there. The director later went on doing an actual fantasy movie: an adaptation of *Beauty and the Beast*. This one isn’t without problems, but it has great sets and a stone giant, so...

One of our national specialties is animation, so that’s where you can find most of our fantasy movies.

*A Monster in Paris*, *Kaena: The Prophecy*, *The Rain Children*, *Babar: King of the Elephants*, *Dragon Hunters*, *The King and the Mockingbird* (A.K.A. *The Curious Adventure of Mr. Wonderbird*), *Mune: Guardian of the Moon*, *Pachamama*, *The Red Turtle*, *Phantom Boy*, *The Little Prince*, *Zombillenium* come to mind.

The animated movies of Michel Ocelot are always interesting. He did the *Kirikou* trilogy (inspired by African fairy tales, there is non sexual nudity if you need warning), *Azur &amp; Asmar* (inspired by 1001 Nights), *Tales of the Night* (fairy tales rendered in silhouettes), and *Dilili in Paris* (period adventure).  

I will add more later.",Fantasy

Maybe if there were consequences to that which might be in the next book but probably not because nobody will give a shit about Thomas with everything else going on.",Fantasy

5112,"I agree with this so strongly that I want to just drop what I'm doing and read your recommendations.

I think that the distinction between prose, world-building, plot and character is basically artificial. Sure, they can be distinguished, but I think that in a well-told story, it's very hard to cleanly separate them. You feel immersed in the world and care about the characters *because* they are well-written. The plot works because you care about the characters. Sometimes I feel like the authors who are praised for 'prose' but criticized for 'world-building' are actually good at both, and those who are praised for world-building but criticized for prose in fact can't do either (except in the sense that their story could make for an interesting wiki to browse or something).",Fantasy

5127,"As a counterpoint to most of the praise here: I'm on the third book of the series and finding it a terrible slog.  I thought the first book was fine, but the only reason I kept reading was because of how people rave about the amazing ending.

The books are _extremely_ plot driven and thick with infodumps about the magic system and the backstory.  (If I were generous I'd call the backstory ""intricate"", but ""convoluted"" would fit too.)  Coupled with the fact that I never really warmed up to the characters, this led to a lot of skimming on my part as I tried to read past all the exposition to get to the good stuff.  The magic system is so mechanical that it doesn't really feel magical at all.  There _are_ some good twists now and then, but I was never really invested enough to appreciate them.

For context: I _like_ cool magic and epic conflicts in my stories, but I _need_ good characters and relationships.  (I like Brandon Sanderson's stuff, but far prefer Robin Hobb.)",Fantasy

I'll throw in Hugh Cooks Chronicles from an Age of Darkness. They were written before the genre got a name, but they are a definite inspiration for guys like Mieville and fit into the genre, IMO. They mix traditional (but inverted) tropes into a weird and surreal world. In it, there is a northern part to the continent that is ""traditional"" fantasy (although, as I said, inverted) while to the south is a very alien and surreal world. The novels tell the story of the walls (or trench) between the two zones collapsing and the alien monsters to the south taking over the ""civilised"" lands to the north. But that's just the setting.

It wouldn't be anything close to the Stand though - that was 2 stormlight books worth.

Actually, **Cradle** might fit well here.

""For the sake of being dark,"" like, of course some people just do it to appeal to those who like that sort of thing, but every genre exists for a reason, and some people write what is seen as Grimdark to tell the story they want to tell, to say the things they want to say.

On your other point though, I've read two series often referred to as Grimdark, Broken Empire and Black Company. I feel like, while the two series have things in common, First Law has almost nothing in common with those. I agree that First Law isn't Grimdark at all. It just has a lot of dark aspects to it.

&gt; Valentine noted that while some writers have embraced the term, others see it as ""a dismissive term for fantasy that's dismantling [tropes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_tropes), a stamp unfairly applied.""

I could also use:

*  **Fred the Vampire Accountant** by Drew Hayes. Quite a few laughs. Using it for Optimistic right now
* **Redemption in Indigo** by Karen Lord. A mixed bag for my tastes - so greatness, but overall disappointing. Using it for the colour square.
* **The Scaled Tartan** by Raymond St Elmo. Such a great series and while not comedy focussed St Elmo knows how to play humour well. Currently using for self pubbed
* **The Hammer of the Gods: So You Want to be a Star** by Andrew Marc Rowe. Currently using for Canadian. The humour is very, very, very, very..... very low brow. If you want lots a dick and sex jokes this will be a good one to read. Me, I think toning it down a few notches would have made for a better read.

Honestly, most the books I've read have made me laugh at some point, so I've limited the list...

If we're going to look at books/authors I've read historically that have had solid laughs:

* Pratchett and Douglas Adams. Duh
* Orconomics was great and the scene with the Orcs ""kidnapping"" our heroes, only for us to discover what was really happening - top 5 book laughs of all time.
* Alan Dean Foster was great at mixing humour and plot. Spellsinger is the obvious entry point
* Hugh Cooks books had some great dark humour
* I have fond memories of Craig Shaw Gardner, although it's been 25 years since I read his stuff...

5210,"Thanks for the comment. So, I can see how two contrasting features can be present in the same person. The two contrasts are also really well conveyed by Abraham. However, the switch between the contrasts isn't seamless enough for my taste in the case of Geder or Cithrin.  

For example, when Geder kills Dawson and then immediately tries to woo Cithrin, I can totally understand what Abraham was aiming for. However, to me, there's a certain nuance of psychopathy that just went unexplored in that moment. It would have really elevated my connection with the character. 

After the burning of Vanai, I can understand how Geder could blame others for his decision, but the character-work that preceded that moment somehow led me to believe there'd be some turbulent internal monologue on Geder's part to justify burning 10,000 people. Instead, we get a couple of references to the incident in Geder's prose and we move on. It could work if Geder were Jorg from the Prince of Thorns, but he isn't. Only a character that was incredibly callous with the lives of thousands would behave like that. And I just couldn't see Geder being that kind of person.

Cithrin's contrasts gel better than those of Geder's but it's easier to overlook the gaps since they're not as central to the plot (as yet) compared to Geder's due, in part, to how ordinary Marcus' arc has been.  Once again, the contrasts in her behavior are clear to me, but at moments the shift can be a little jarring.",Fantasy

5223,"I wasn't in a position earlier to really say what it's about, but the below snippet is from Wikipedia:

Vlad Taltos, a mobster and assassin in the magical metropolis of Adrilankha, is given the largest contract of his career, but the job is even more complicated than he expects. 

Essentially, the main character is like a mid-level mob boss in a fantasy city. He's clever, snarky (And his familiar, Loioish, is possibly even more snarky), and his initial 'job' usually spirals into some other plot or becomes more complicated. They're all very fun books. 

One thing I'll mention, though, is that the author eventually got annoyed at people asking him when the next book would come out and started writing them out of chronological order. The first few are a block, but then they start hopping around and aren't direct sequels. He does a fantastic job of keeping the necessary information contained within the books so it doesn't feel disjointed while at the same time not feeling like you're constantly getting barraged by things you already knew.

He also has fun with his table of contents. In one of the books the table of contents functions as a list of instructions to his dry-cleaner and each item to be cleaned indicates something that got dirtied or damaged during that chapter. In another book each chapter is preceded by a small excerpt where he's in a restaraunt and talks about each course of a meal. Very imaginative and fun.",Fantasy

There's also the journal &gt;!in the rucksack of the murdered man that drives questions about the rose oil conflict/the mystical city in the desert and also the ""Middle Eastern"" myth of the lovers (if I recall?) that Lyra seems to be embodying but I don't think those quite count since they are not books in the strict sense of the word.!&lt;

5288,"I had to delete my Goodreads review because it upset some Dresden fans, so going to try to remember everything I said. A few general points:

\-Upon first reading, this was a 2 star book. I have been unable to re-read the book. I even skipped the first 6 chapters on the last re-read attempt. I decided I hated this as much, if not more, than Fool Moon.

\-This book has made me seriously consider if I am still a fan of the series.

\-The commentary around this book (the publisher said the hardcover would be too expensive! I wanted to do good by the fans!) basically all sounded like the age-old issue of the publisher seeing dollar signs when they looked at an author, as opposed to saying, ""Yo. Cut 15% out of this book."" Which a 2005 Jim Butcher would have been told to do. 2020 (well, 2019) Butcher was told to make it into 2 books.  


Specifics:

\-A lot of scenes could have been combined to keep the Dresden feel. i.e. If the Butters throuple is so important, it could have easily been incorporated into the Sanya scene. Ditto the disjointed Eb/Rameriz scenes. That could have all been combined into a chapter.

\-I don't know how to refer to it other than ""weird sex shit."" But, there was a lot of weird sex shit. From YOU WILL TELL US WHO YOU ARE BANGING to THREESOMES FOR ALL to ALL HOT GIRLS ARE BI AND READY TO FUCK. It was just...weird.

\-I can't remember the female warden's name, but the entire ""she's a ninja"" descriptions had, I don't know what to call it - exoticism? I don't know, but there was something really off about it, since most are described in the same way.

5308,"Sanderson is the obvious answer, but honestly most authors who churn out books at a tremendous pace (King for exemple) tend to have poor prose. I'm of the opinion that most people can write a beautiful string of sentences given enough time, and authors simply use that method on a much larget scale. It's no surprise that people like Guy Gavriel Kay or Patrick Rothfuss, who are known for their very flowery proses, are also some of the slowest writers as well. 

On the flipside, having a simplistic prose does not make it bad, it's simply another style. One of my go-to exemple is Michael J Sullivan's Ryiria Revelations series, it's an extremely simple prose style that perfectly fits the story told. The prose carries the reader seamlessly from one point to the other, never noticeable. And unnoticeable is exactly what a simple prose should strive to be. 

No matter how you personally prefer your style of prose to be, if a book's prose pulls you out of the immersion, be it by too many repetitions of the same words or expressions, by very poor dialogues or by a really overdone metaphor, then it's doing a poor job.",Fantasy

5312,"Prydain books are one subversion.  I think at the end Taran is still a mysterious orphan of unknown parentage.

Tolkien's a mixed bag.  Aragorn is of a bloodline and his distant ancestors -- elves and a Maia -- actually *are* better than you in various way.  Though most of being a Dunadan is divine blessing, not genetic -- the Numenoreans didn't suddenly start living 200+ years because they had the right genes, and lifespans didn't actually diminish due to interbreeding.  Meanwhile, the hobbits as a 'race' are pretty small and ordinary, but Frodo is rich gentry and Pippin and Merry are basically crown princes.  OTOH Sam seems common and ends up getting elected Mayor... though somewhere obscure, Tolkien wrote that his daughter's blonde hair was sign of Fallohide ancestry.  Doh!

The Kencyrath books are a different subversion.  Magical racism and castes are real and it's recognized by the main characters as sucking even though they themselves are on top, especially the way the service/warrior Kendar are bound to the Highborn.

OTOH having magic limited by bloodline often seems necessary for not having the world overrun by magic.",Fantasy

5323,"I have to say that the style of worldbuilding I most appreciate tends to go roughly hand in hand with a certain attention to prose. A lot of the times we default to imagining worldbuilding as the construction of lore-as-summary-received-knowledge detailing unambiguously the large scale facets of the world.

Personally, the 'worldbuilding' I find most effective are the consistent and reappearing details that convince me of the experience of inhabiting a character's life. What are the neighborhoods of their city like, or the areas around the town they live in, what kinds of eateries do they frequent, what is material culture like, what mash of cultures do they encounter. I'm not saying its a pure correlation but the conveyance of these kinds of details does tend to come along with a similarly detail oriented eye for well crafted prose.  


Edit: I realized I mentioned no one concrete here. I love China Mieville's work. I love Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence. I think both are excellent worldbuilders and have a strong eye for prose, but neither of them is close to pinning down their worlds with summary received lore.",Fantasy

5337,"I'll echo the feeling of how disjointed it seemed. To copy from what I put in GR, it really reminded me of one of those reunion episodes where plot keeps getting interrupted by cameos and scene changes to cram in everyone we've ever met before, and a lot of it doesn't really contribute to anything - this is the shortest book in a long time and yet it felt like it needed to trim down. 

I could *kind* of get the motivation for how Ebenezer was acting, but it's like right out the gate he behaves so differently from every time we've seen before, and all to serve building to this big fight, that then has no stakes because it resolved with a deus ex machina. So, I guess both good and bad that it felt like there were a bunch of points Butcher knew he wanted to get us to, but it felt inorganic and convoluted all the details of how we got there.

I was probably unreasonably bothered by the wardens so adamantly demanding to know who Harry had sex with, as if wardens have to check in every time they get laid or his conflicts of interest require him to do so yet somehow don't exclude him from being a warden in the first place. It just felt dumb and another way to be real weird about sex. Which, yea, anything sexual still weird/awkward af in this book.

I'm also kind of bothered that this built up a whole huge thing about how just obscenely horrible it is seeing Thomas so drained, when we heard right from the beginning that is basically what they are going to choose to put Justine through and like no real big objections to that?

We also didn't get any huge losses, so I assume those are coming. Harry kept heavy handedly reminiscing about how life was so easy before he had people, and how much he missed his home/lab. We got the home/lab tie-in in this one, and then obviously the wedge between him and gramps, but I wonder how much/who he is going to lose in Battle Ground.

The beginning is slow as he spends a lot of time portraying what is normal life for the main character before things go crazy.  He is very descriptive so sometimes it can seem like his books drag if you don't enjoy the way he writes.  I do enjoy it so I will take pretty much anything he has to say.  The series was written in the late 80s/ early 90s so some of it can seem dated if you have read a lot of current fantasy, but he was one of the big influences on modern fantasy with Martin being the most famous.  

He has continued his work in the world that MST takes place and is completing a trilogy next year.

It's like if King saw 40 years into the future upon starting to write it, and saw ""Ok, now I know no hack will be able to copy or imitate me, and the story will be the most unique in fantasy for several decades to come, nice.""

The fantasy genre itself basically evolved from its origins in the epic poem tradition and grew over the centuries, to lead up to King attempting this series. The fact that he kind of doesn't fully succeed and may have even failed at the end just adds to the romance and tragedy of it all.",Fantasy

It was almost usual Dresden business, but this time he's a ghost for a change and has hard time interacting.

That said, I was disappointed in other ways, namely the sexism. I do wonder how much of my annoyance is this book in particular, and how much is me. I've been reading the Dresden Files as they've come out since Blood Rites, which released in 2004, and I was in middle school then (yeah, I know). For most of the series' run I was a lot less critical of narrative flaws. But between 2014, when the last book was released (Skin Game) and now, I've read a lot of other books, and have become aware that certain things bother me that I hadn't paid as much attention to before.

5446,"I mean, by that standard, a Swedish Bronze Age person in 1250 BC pretty much lived the same life as a Swedish 17th century farmer. Which, I guess is true in a sense? A farmers day to day experience in a similar geographic area didn’t change much for thousands of years. But societally, those two people lived very different lives, and were part of very different social structures. 

In the late 1500’s, early 1600’s, Sweden (as an example) changed a lot. The state became administratively much more advanced. We started counting citizens much more frequently and accurately. Every farm in the kingdom was registered and sized up for taxation purposes. Every citizen had to learn to read, write and recite the Bible (which until the reformation had only been available in Latin). There was a standing army that you could join or be drafted into. Urbanization increased quickly and a much bigger part of the population had other jobs than being a farmer. A whole new class of civil servants came into being. State control over citizens grew (for instance, you needed a passport to travel within the country).

5455,"I have to disagree.      
     
I think the core issue with your assessments is that your looking at the situations as allegories for specific issues and situations. And in those comparisons the following themes and messages have some very problematic connotations. But only because of the precedent and comparison you yourself set. Not because of whats actually in the books.     
       
For clarity the biggest example here is you pointing to mistborn as a clear allegory for american slavery. I dont think thats a fair assessment at all. I think it breaks down the issues with slavery as a whole, humanizes slaves, and shows things like generational trauma rational assumptions, etc. And the issues with them. Because it covers this issue well it works as an allegory for american slavery... or slavery in the middle east... or asian slavery... or russian and european feudalism... etc. The important note is that sanderson has made his situations have significant differencrs to make it clear the messages womt be 1:1 transferable. Eugenics wasnt implemented successfully in a systematic and purposeful way in american slavery. The actual augmenting on a genetic level in mistborn serves to make it clear that this is a different fantastical situation. Any theme or message looked at should be with the understanding of this difference.      
     
When rasheks described as a good guy that did these things i dont believe the message is that thesr arent disqualifiers from being a good person. Its that a good person can do evil things. That they can become an evil person. And the journey can start and continue with good intentions. I thought the story adequately stressed that while even evil rashek was trying to save the world, his actions as lord ruler were evil. But he did these things not becausr a good person could make these mistakes, but because he had a force of nature, a literal devil, manipulating what he saw felt and and who he was. That he would never have done these things without the influence of ruin. That these were the evil things a force of ruin would have someone do. Eugenics, rape, slaughter were the actions that defined rashek the well intentioned as a person corrupted and influenced. And the story of skaa success and perspective was meant to clarify that these were flawed ideals and goals. To really stress that the actions of the wannabe savior are only not justifiable but not effective. This is a message that i appreciate because we dont need to teach most people hitler was bad. Most know that. We need to teach people that think eugenics makes sense but were used evilly or that minoritys need to be saved instead of empowered that thesr machinations are just as wrong as the people whove used them, are wrong in any situation, and dissuade people from the white savior complex thats much more common than abject racism. And i dont think sanderson wrote it with this goal, but i think the effects of him writing these situations without mirroring specific situations makes it applicable in great ways like this. All of the issues you bring up as having problematic implications are problematic in the worlds and plots where he writes them. They shouldnt be applied as specific messages to real world situations with a bunch of variables. If we look at lopen as a capable handicapped character, and a super hero who grew back lubs than both of thosr are great. We can be better people by espousing those concepts. If we try to apply it to the real world you can get the message that hadicapped people cant be superheros, but the worlds sanderson writes are so dramatically different that it encourages not doing that. This is just the story of one strong handicapped character. And the concept of superheroes in stormlight is that they become them by first being broken and persevering. The whole idea of the radiants is to empower those who feel broken. If we just look at that message and not the situation as a whole, even his superheroes are empowering to the disabled. Dalinar has memory issues. Shallan is developing multiple pursonality disorder (but im still finsihing oathbringer and seeing whats happening). If we focus on the singular messages i dont see either series as espousing negative acts. I just think they feature them in a way that adds more nuance to the struggles his characters and even worlds as a whole face.

5476,"I'll repeat what I've said before - not a good book regardless of the next one. It's disjointed with plot overruling the character, Lara being the main victim. She acts completely differently 3 times we meet her, and acts during the first evening of talks completely opposite of what she said at the gym. Last confrontation on the island and motivation for Lara being furious feels completely tackled on - suddenly she thinks Harry doesn't care for Thomas at all and wants to kill him?

And it happens with all characters - they all act differently when before. And it doesn't get acknowledged by main hero. Also there are many smaller moments in the book that feel like an author didn't reread his series before writing this one - the names are there, but details and some characterization misses the mark.

Another big issue for me was a lack on drive - whole ""I've got to save Thomas"" wasn't engaging, and the secondary storyline (at least for this book) of Peace Talks was much more interesting, probably because it advances main plot, and rescuing Thomas is plot we've experienced before several times already. So this lack of drive leads to the book feeling like it's another Ghost Story - an overblown collection of scenes with some encounters that could have been edited out and with leftover essentials written in shorter form.

And I was also annoyed by ramped up sex theme - reminded me of direction Anita Blake went in past Obsidian Butterfly, but to a lesser degree. And sexualization of underage girls didn't help either (for those who don't understand and say that it's normal, whole characterization only two female teenagers in the book was ""she's named this, does this, here's a sign of her sexual maturity"", so it's about ratio, not only the fact itself).

And before ""you just didn't like it because there was no ending"", no, I don't care about that, I knew there would be a second part anyway. I like serialized storytelling when it's done well. This book uses usual storytelling instruments, but does it mostly unsuccessfully, and feels like it lacks soul",Fantasy

He tried to unbutton his coat, but ended up bending forward with his knuckles pressing his forehead, digging into his skin as he hyperventilated, gasping in deep breaths of air while he trembled and shook. Exhaustionspren like jets of dust gleefully congregated around him. And agonyspren, like upside-down faces carved from stone, twisted and faded in and out.

&gt;He couldn’t cry. Nothing came out. He wanted to cry, because at least that would be a release. Instead he huddled, knuckles pressing against the scars in his forehead, wishing he could shrivel away. Like the eyes of a person struck by a Shardblade.

&gt;In moments like this—alone and huddled on the floor of a dark room, tormented by agonyspren—Moash’s words found him. The truth of them became undeniable. Out in the garish sunlight, it was easy to pretend that everything was all right. In here, Kaladin could see clearly.

5521,"I'll say this, though: Abercrombie's writing skills have improved immensely since The Blade Itself. It makes sense, the guy gets better as a writer as he writes more and more. I don't know if he has a better editor as well? But Red Country (for example) is much, much better in terms of writing, pacing and storytelling versus Blade Itself.

Not disagreeing with the sentiments here... it's probably best to start at the beginning. Just keep in mind that (IMO, at least) his writing gets progressively better and better. So if you have issues with the first couple books, those issues might not appear in all of his writing.

I almost stopped reading Best Served Cold as it was overly long, and got repetitive and the entire thing was scattered feeling. By Red Country, his writing and general construction of the novel was just immensely better.

Certainly by the end of the 17th century we're starting to see something that sort of resembles the modern world in terms of political philosophy and the very beginnings of modern technology with the steam engine mine pumps, but I think that's just one of those things where the more things change the more they stay the same.  I don't think an argument can be made, or supported, for the thesis of the ""middle ages"" lasting until the concert of Europe but I definitely don't think that the period up to about 1650-1675 is outside of the realm of possibilities of being included as part of the middle ages... certainly Don Quixote would indicate an emerging idea of nominally thinking of themselves as different but it also shows how big of a hold that medieval popculture still had in at the start of the 17th century.

Mage: tend to be the general practitioner if magic think fireballs and such, often connected to elemental magic.

Wizard: in addition to be a practitioner of magic wisards also tend to be in the old wise mentor role think Gandalf/Merlin.

Sorcerer: a bit of a mix between the mage and wizard perhaps a bit more on the arcane side and normally don't inhabit the wise mentor role.

Witch can be the female version of wizard but is often more on the darker side, think black magic and hexes.

Warlock: the druids darker cousin is similar to the druid in some aspects but don't tend to be as nature focused but instead spirits and such and in some incarnations the demonic as well",Fantasy

There’s a huge difference between the 1300’s and the 1600’s.

**The Dark Tower** as a series is King's finalized version of his own **Cosmere**, as Roland's quest touches upon settings and characters from many of King's earlier works, binding them into a unified metaverse. It is a story of love, and loss. Of ruthlessness, and redemption.

Reaper Gale :( ...  


&gt;!He did not know why he was thinking about his brother now, as he set ablaze every candle within him to make the world bright and to save all his friends. And before long he no longer sensed anyone else, barring the faint smudges they had become. The captain, the Fist, all the soldiers who were his friends, he let his light unfold to embrace them all, to keep them safe from that frightening, dark magic so eager to rush down upon them.!&lt;

​

&gt;!It had grown too powerful for those seven mages to contain. They had created something that would now destroy them, but Beak would not let it hurt his friends. And so he made his light burn yet brighter. He made of it a solid thing. Would it be enough? He did not know, but it had to be, for without friends there was nothing, no-one.!&lt;

​

[...]

​

​

&gt;!Beak was happy to save them. He had understood that old sergeant. The twisted mage, alas, could not embrace such purification. Too much of his soul had been surrendered. The others – oh, they were wounded, filled with bitterness that he needed to sweep away, and so he did.!&lt;

​

&gt;!Nothing was difficult any more. Nothing!&lt;

​

​

[...]

&gt;!Beak was driven down by the immense weight, the horrible hunger. Yet he would not retreat. Instead, he let the fire within him lash out, devouring every candle, igniting everything.!&lt;

​

&gt;!His friends, yes, the only ones he had ever known.!&lt;

​

&gt;!Survival, he realized, could only be found through purity. Of his love for them all – how so many of them had smiled at him, laughed with him. How hands clapped him on the shoulder and even, now and then, tousled his hair.!&lt;

​

&gt;!He would have liked to see the captain one last time, and maybe even kiss her. On the cheek, although of course he would have liked something far more ... brave. But he was Beak, after all, and he could hold on to but one thing at a time.!&lt;

​

&gt;!Arms wrapped tight, even as the fire began to burn the muscles of his arms. His shoulders and neck. His legs.!&lt;

​

&gt;!He could hold on, now, until they found him.!&lt;

​

&gt;!Those fires were so hot, now, burning – but there was no pain. Pain had been scoured away, cleansed away. Oh, the weight was vast, getting heavier still, but he would not let go. Not of his brothers and his sisters, the ones he so loved.!&lt;

​

&gt;!My friends.!&lt;

​

​

[...]

&gt;!Gleaming armour and weapons. Hair white as snow, faces devoid of all scars. Figures, picking themselves up in a half-daze, rising like perfect conjurations from the brilliant green shoots of some kind of grass that now snarled everything and seemed to be growing before her eyes.!&lt;

​

&gt;!And, turning, she looked upon Beak.!&lt;

​

&gt;!To burn, fire needed fuel.!&lt;

​

&gt;!To save them all, Beak had used all the fuel within him.!&lt;

​

&gt;!In horror, Faradan Sort found herself staring at a collapsed jumble of ashes and scorched bone. But no, there was pattern within that, a configuration, if she could but focus through her tears. Oh. The bones of the arms seemed to be hugging the knees, the crumpled skull settled on them.!&lt;

Like, for instance in Game of Thrones, the show, Dany constantly goes on about wanting to 'break the wheel' but instead of doing that, of deconstructing the feudal society that gave birth to her hardships, she just commits a war crime and attempts to make herself the axel that wheel revolves around.

I think that Howard certainly has a place as what is effectively the initial genesis of a uniquely American branch of fantasy... but both Howard (maybe)/Lovecraft/Smith and Tolkien/Peake/Eddison read Dunsany and that's where you really get, in my opinion, one of the two common ancestors between the two main branches of modern fantasy, the other of course was Edgar Rice Burroughs who Tolkien mentioned several times in letters and other locations, had enormous market penetration in dozens of languages, and was extremely prolific.",Fantasy

5601,"Warlock has some dark connotations. Magician has modern connotations of someone doing party tricks. But really, there's no specific meaning attached to them. There's no connection to social rank or cultural background in any way, imo. 

In some stories witches are the typical kind of evil, potion brewing magical people that eat children. In some, it has more wicca vibes. And then you have Harry Potter witches, which is just the female version of Wizard. In C.S. Friedman's Magister Trilogy, witches were weaker magic users that mostly had to rely on gestures, words and such to do magic, and their magic was called witchery (which covered everything from healing to shapeshifting and throwing balls of fire). Magisters were much more powerful magic users, and they used sorcery (but were not really called sorcerers).

You can go D&amp;D style and say that Wizards tend towards having to learn by study ... but then you have something like ""hedge wizard"" which you see here and there, with the implication that these are magic users that learnt things on their own or from passed down knowledge, rather than in a formal educational setting.

But then you also have the Witcher books, in which all magic users are called sorcerers/sorceresses, and they very much go to learn magic at prestigious academies and study for years, even centuries, and use all kinds of magic.

And there's the classic Riftwar saga, where the protagonist when to study magic with a magician, who was a typical high fantasy magic user.

Bayan is revealed to be a construct created by the Emperor.  Lin discovers that she is a copy of the Emperor's wife, Nisong.  Everything about Lin losing her memories was an effort by the Emperor to implant Nisong's memories into her.  Bayan is only there because the Emperor thinks that Lin would work harder with competition.  Lin and Bayan team up to kill the Emperor.  Bayan is killed, but Lin uses the Emperor's personal attack dog construct to kill him.  The construct was originally created by the Nisong, so it answers to her, and Lin, before the Emperor.  Lin finds the Emperor's lab and finds another creature like Mephi and sets it free.

Jovis somehow starts getting superpowers from Mephi. He teams up with Ranami and the Shardless to help overthrow Phalue's father in exchange for information on the ship that took his wife.  They do, but Jovis prevents the Shardless leader from killing the governor and Phalue.  Phalue is made governor and Ranami finally accepts her marriage proposal.  Jovis learns that the ship that took his wife always stops at Imperial Island.  So he goes there and fights a construct which tells him that his wife is long dead.  Jovis meets Lin and he realizes that Lin's eyes are the same as his wife's.

I'm not sure how much I buy it but it is interesting in the same way that Phillip Bobbit's thesis that the period from about 1914-1990 constituted one singularly large conflict rather than any kind of discrete ones as we would normally categorize it. In certain ways I'd say that things really didn't change dramatically enough culturally or technologically until the late 18th century for it to be an easy shift... and that's sort of the real rub of it to be honest is an idea that no development was happening for nearly a thousand years between 500 and 1500 is just really preposterous.   


Certainly there are people who don't quite grasp periodization and just know a greatest hits of ""Good periods"" versus ""bad periods"" when it comes to history... but yeah having taught some undergrads I've certainly seen people who think that Beethoven is a renaissance artist for instance... terms like Baroque are basically meaningless to most people...",Fantasy

Was that all through the Middle Ages, or just the end?

I feel near the end their was a tendency to build a ""cult"" around the monarchy to make the monarchy seem like something inevitable and eternal.  Pomp built up near the end of the Middle Ages.  (This was kind of a royal PR campaign that has heavily influenced Fantasy.)  I'm not convinced they had the luxury for that kind of pomp during the collapse of the Roman Empire.    


Which leads to another problem with portrayals of the Middle Ages.  The Middle Ages was a really long time, about a thousand years by some definitions, and whole continent.  England in the late 16th century wasn't much like Poland in the 12th.  Modern Fantasy tends to cherry pick thing from periods centuries apart, and lump  them together.",Fantasy

5637,"Spoilers for the whole Broken Earth Trilogy by NK Jemisin

I love how Jemisin explores the theme of generational trauma and how those who hurt us could do so out of love. Essun knew that it vital for Nassun to control her orogeny and she knew the world wouldn't accept her unless she was perfect.


""Tell them there is a standard for acceptance; that standard is simply perfection""

This speaks so much to me and the pain I inherited from my parents, especially my mom. I sometimes can't breath because of the expectations placed on me and the verbal abuse (I'm too old for physical discipline) that is their ""love"" language. It reminds me of a quote in Between The World and Me by Ta Nehisi Coates:

""My father was so very afraid. I felt it in the sting of his black leather belt, which he applied with more anxiety than anger, my father who beat me as if someone might steal me away, because that was exactly what was happening all around us""

Yeah the books are about the end of the world, but its more about the breaking of generational trauma and understanding that your parents loved you the best way they could love. Again and again Essun acknowledges that her emotions aren't right, she acknowledges that the world is really what she's mad at, angry at but that is the world that she lives in and so she makes due.

Another thing I absolutely love is how Shaffa treats Nassun better than Damaya, I love that Jemisin acknowledges that our abusers might be other people's heroes

Also worth mentioning (but it is a bit more of a long shot, to be honest) **Life Reset** series (technically, the correct name is New Era Online series, but everyone call it Life Reset) by Shemer Kuznits, which is LitRPG. The MC is a human player in a VR game, who got stuck in the game when, due to stuff, he is reincarnated into the body of a goblin (which is a NP race in the game) and he is unable to log out. I have conflicted feelings regarding litRPG in general: often the writing is quite amateurish (IMHO this is not a problem with this series, however) and when I asked for suggestions regarding this genre, I did not like around 70% of the series hat were recommended, however I found some ""hidden gems"" among them (my personal ""Holy Trinity"" of litRPG are Dakota Krout, Shemer Kuznits and Andrew Rowe).",Fantasy

I’m an archaeologist, not an historian, but I think pretty few historians would extend the “Middle Ages” to the mid-1600’s.  Feudalism is not generally considered an essential feature of the period - large areas of Europe never really developed a feudal system during the Middle Ages.

The end date of the Middle Ages does vary from region to region. Where I live in Sweden, we generally extend the Middle Age to 1528 (the year when the Protestant church of Sweden was formed, basically the Reformation). That’s ~150 years after Italy, so it was definitely a long, complicated process.

5698,"I think ""The New Weird"" ended up being more a marketing term and a general statement of anti-Tolkien, anti-epic fantasy sentiment than a genre with definite aesthetic boundaries, though many of the works categorized as ""New Weird"" tend to be grotesque, decadent, and dreamlike. Imagine if Borges or Calvino were writing contemporary genre novels. New Weird writers saw Mervyn Peake rather than Tolkien as their progenitor; their settings tended to break out of the cod-medieval mode that had become the norm in fantasy; their settings were often urban rather than pastoral; their politics tended to be left-wing. The standout New Weird novels are:

The Etched City by KJ Bishop: part western, part 19th century French symbolism, this novel follows the lives of a doctor and a mercenary, both of whom fought on the losing side of a revolution, as they make their way through a strange and decadent city.

Perdido Street Station by China Mieville: The New Weird's hottest club is Perdido Street Station. This one's got everything: bird people, insect people, frog people, a woman whose head is a beetle, a multidimensional spider, giant moths that eat your dreams, and the crappiest crapsack city imaginable. Read anything by China Mieville if you're interested in the New Weird.

Palimpsest by Catherynne M. Valente: another novel set in a weird, often grotesque, city. I love the narrative voice of this one.

City of Saints and Madmen by Jeff Vandermeer: Not really a novel but a collection of stories set in another weird, quasi-Victorian decadent city. Worth it for the first novella (Dradin in Love) alone.

If you want to venture into more experimental prose, check out the works of Michael Cisco.

If you want a more straightforwardly epic fantasy feel, check out The Year of Our War by Steph Swainston.

The Iron Dragon's Daughter by Michael Swanwick predates the New Weird moniker, but it is definitely New Weird-adjacent.

The omnibus edition of Viriconium by M. John Harrison came out around the time ""New Weird"" was becoming a thing, and Harrison is the one who coined the term, so I would check this out even though some of the works collected here are as old as the 70s and 80s. You'll definitely see his influence all over New Weird stuff.",Fantasy

I love the hobbits for exactly that reason and Sam is my favourite. Just like Mat is my favourite of the 3 Taveren, and Nyneave is my absolulte favourite character in wheel of time. Rand's morals come from Tam. the dragon reborn part...

I just think getting into all the nuances of all the examples was going to muddy the point; that our society still operates under a social caste, and individual personal worth is still seen too much under the guise of heritage, and not ability. 

Part of it the wishfullfilment that I didn't touch upon is that its a bit safe right to want divine right in fantasy, because it eases the mind a bit - yeah ofcourse they can do what they want, because they're secretly in the better caste, that's why i'm stuck here where i am, regardless of my effort and seen as what i am, regardless of my humanity.

5713,"- _Damselle in Distress_ by Kiley Kellermeyer is a take on fairy tales (Damselle's ""superpower"" is that she constantly needs saving. It's funny. Trust me.)

- Anything Discworld, but particularly the night watch series is right up your alley here

- Most of the Dragonlance novels from the 90s would fit the bill. I haven't read much Dragonlance in the last 15 years, so I can't speak to more recent novels.

- _The Land of Dis_ series, starting with _Disenchanted_, by Robert Kroese is pretty funny. It's satirical and humorous. The main character, Boris the Implacable, is... well, ""implacted""... on the first page, and his ghost has to pull his dead body around for the rest of the book and recruit help to free his soul. It's pretty good. In fact, I'd say any of Kroese's books are the kind of light-hearted fantasy that you're talking about.

- Doesn't really fit the ""different races"" thing, but almost anything by Lindsay Buroker fits the rest of your requirements. Her first series, _The Emperor's Edge_, is a small cast of characters on a funny, snarky, sometimes serious, sometimes absurd adventures. She's also got about 40 books out, so there's plenty to read here. They're almost all available on Audible, as well. Can't speak highly enough of Buroker and her works.

- Kill the Farmboy, by Kevin Hearne and Delilah S. Dawson, is a satirical adventure about... well, a farmboy and a chosen one and the Dark Lord Toby and... it's funny! There's a goat and all kinds of hijinks. Haven't read the other books yet, but this one was enjoyable.

- Anything in the _Xanth_ universe by Piers Anthony would fit this as well. He's a bit controversial these days. His writings can be pervy and misogynistic and all kinds of things like that, but... they are funny and cross lots of different realms and creatures and they have audiobook versions. They take place in a magical world that happens to look like the state of Florida, and they're full of puns and various creatures and so on. Each book is essentially a standalone, but there are crossover references from book to book. Figured I'd mention this, even though it might not be popular.",Fantasy

5719,"Interesting! It looks like the association of ""witch"" with female goes back many centuries though so I think the association does have some weight. Of course it's arbitrary in the end I just mean that it's an association older than modern books.

Your comment about witch vs warlock was interesting to me so I tried to look it up. As far as I can tell the pairing of those two goes back fairly far: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlock)

That isn't to disagree that specific lore gets confused for older definitions at all (wizard vs sorcerer from D&amp;D is the one I see most frequently). I just think that in this case the origins seem to be older than modern novels.

&gt; D&amp;D has a long history of taking terms that mean basically the same  thing (fairy vs elf, or wizard vs sorcerer) and making them into  separate things. I think this originally was just to pad out the monster  manual, but the concept developed own legs and now we keep trying to  micro-categorize. 

Yeah you'll often find me going on about over-categorization in these threads. But on the other hand... there's a pretty long tradition of that in general. Dwarves and elves in early Norse mythology for example. Or even ""cow"" and ""beef"" getting separate definitions.

So who knows what wizardly definitions will be entrenched a hundred years from now?",Fantasy

5721,"&gt;but honestly it feels more like a classic war movie but in a fantasy setting

Joe Abercrombie has indicated that that was exactly his intent. The standalones were all written as ""what if X movie genre but in fantasy"". Best Served Cold was a mafia revenge movie, The Heroes was a classic war movie, and Red Country was a western.",Fantasy
5722,"So, I feel like there's two impulses intertwined here. One is the question of whether we have to be people of some sort of divine (perhaps hereditary?) provenance to be great people, and the other is whether we must do 'great' deeds to be great/good/worthwhile people.   


If a lot of Fantasy (and SFF/spec fic more broadly) is in some way consolatory/escapist, I find it mildly unsurprising that a lot of people want to find in it stories of people doing great wondrous things and leading great wondrous lives. Nevertheless it's also absolutely worth pushing back on that narrative in and of itself.   


Once you've dragged that out into the light of day, then you can get down to what I think you rightly identify as the more pernicious and dangerous half of the equation, which is the implicit narrative sometimes present in fantasy that in order to be that person who leads that meaningful life with those meaningful deeds (and then settles down into a meaningful life of responsible rule) one has to be of a select lineage.   


I'm a little wary of touching the whole knot that is the SW sequels with a ten foot pole but maybe in thinking about examples I'd raise two. First lets go back to Tolkien. Tolkien is, to my mind, a bit of an interesting example in this regard. On the one hand we have the narrative of Aragorn, of the Dunedain, of Numenor. On the other we have the elevation to protagonists of Bilbo, Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin. Given his 'cordial dislike' of allegory I remain a bit wary of overinvesting our reading in Aragorn and ignoring the role the hobbits played (though there is still quite a bit of political implication to be mined there).  


The other, since I allotted irrevocably a huge swathe of brainmatter to it, is Wheel of Time, which I mostly bring up because it includes in its cast almost every possible recombination of these. Are the main boys heroes because they are chosen by the pattern? Because they are inheritors of ancient but long humble line? Because of &gt;!utterly irrelevant secret royal blood!&lt;? Are the main girls any less for not being explicitly chosen? Are they better if they want humble goods versus political power?",Fantasy
5723,"You're bound to see this in Western European Medieval Fantasy, because feudalism was a pretty big feature of that time and place. But the tendrils of feudalism run far, and remain in our consciousness still, so it's no wonder things are popular.

You ask, 

&gt;Why do we need so badly to dismiss where we come from when achieving our dreams and goals? Why do we need the legitimacy in our fiction of actually being the rightful king, instead of the chosen king through effort? Why is the place you started from a thing to be seen as shameful? 

It's not that there's a need, unless the person being addressed believes in feudalism, in which case it's pretty central.

If Strider were not the descendant of Isildur he would never ascend the throne of Gondor because Gondor is a hereditary monarchy. It's a hereditary monarchy because that's the system Tolkien wanted to imitate, because it, being so cemented in popular culture, fairytale and legend, was resonant for him and his audience.

There is fiction, including fantasy fiction, not inspired by feudalism, but I don't think there's any mystery or issue with feudalism being commonly portrayed.",Fantasy

5740,"The end of Test of the Twins of Dragonlance Legends by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. SPOILERS BELOW







“Good-bye... my brother,” Caramon said.

Holding Crysania in his arms, the Staff of Magius in one hand, Caramon turned and walked away. The light of the staff formed a circle around him, a circle of silver that shone in the darkness like the moonbeams of Solinari glistening upon the calm waters of Crystalmir Lake. The silver beams struck the dragon’s heads, freezing them, changing them to silver, silencing their screams. Caramon stepped through the Portal. Raistlin, watching him with his soul, caught a blurred glimpse of colors and life and felt a brief whisper of warmth touch his sunken cheek. Behind him, he could hear the mocking laughter gurgle into harsh, hissing breath. He could hear the slithering sounds of a gigantic scaled tail, the creaking of wing tendons. Behind him, five heads whispered words of torment and terror.

Steadfastly, Raistlin stood, staring into the Portal. He saw Tanis run to help Caramon, he saw him take Crysania in his arms. Tears blurred Raistlin’s s vision. He wanted to follow! He wanted Tanis to touch his hand! He wanted to hold Crysania in his arms... He took a step forward.

He saw Caramon turn to face him, the staff in his hand.

Caramon stared into the Portal, stared at his twin, stared beyond his twin. Raistlin saw his brother’s eyes grow wide with fright.

Raistlin did not have to turn to know what his brother saw. Takhisis crouched behind him. He could feel the chill of the loathsome reptile body flow about him, fluttering his robes. He sensed her behind him, yet her thoughts were not on him. She saw her way to the world, standing open...

“Shut it!” Raistlin screamed.

A blast of flame seared Raistlin’s flesh. A taloned claw stabbed him in the back. He stumbled, falling to his knees. But he never took his eyes from the Portal, and he saw Caramon, his twins face anguished, take a step forward, toward him!

“Shut it, you fool!” Raistlin shrieked, clenching his fists. “Leave me alone! I don’t need you any more! I don’t need you!”

And then the light was gone. The Portal slammed shut, and blackness pounced upon him with raging, slathering fury. Talons ripped his flesh, teeth tore through muscle, and crunched bone. Blood flowed from his breast, but it would not take with it his life.

He screamed, and he would scream, and he would keep on screaming, unendingly...

Something touched him... a hand... He clutched at it as it shook him, gently. A voice called,

*“Raist! Wake up! It was only a dream. Don’t be afraid. I won’t let them hurt you! Here, watch... I’ll make you laugh.”*

The dragons coils tightened, crushing out his breath. Glistening black fangs ate his living organs, devoured his heart. Tearing into his body, they sought his soul.

A strong arm encircled him, holding him close. A hand raised, gleaming with silver light, forming childish pictures in the night, and the voice, dimly heard, whispered, *“Look, Raist, bunnies... .”*

He smiled, no longer afraid. Caramon was here.

The pain eased. The dream was driven back. From far away, he heard a wail of bitter disappointment and anger. It didn’t matter. Nothing mattered anymore. Now he just felt tired, so very, very tired...

Leaning his head upon his brother’s arm, Raistlin closed his eyes and drifted into a dark, dreamless, endless sleep.",Fantasy

Egwene’s soul separated from her collapsing body and rested upon that wave, riding it into the Light.”

what will say is A) a lot of the fun of age of madness is the Easter eggs from the original series and the stand alone and also some of the anticipation and tension comes from knowing the characters history so for example one character might be coming off as a bit lost or ineffective but as a reader you know there a ruthless and highly effective schemer and a relentless survivor changes how you read there scenes. So if you don’t have the history you lose that however I don’t think that’s major what might be an issue is B) a lot of twists and turns from the original trilogy and standalone s will be spoiled if you read age of madness first.

its also just a matter of choice Abercrombie is a great writer whatever you choose to do is great and age of madness is a new chapter in the first law universe so starting there is fine.",Fantasy

The [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/witch) of the word is interesting. In Old English it had its own feminine/masculine forms, and the modern form has been used at times in a gender-neutral way. Same for 'wizard'.

Fantasy novels in more recent years have complicated this though. Authors come up with their own lore for their stories (like ""witch"" vs ""warlock"" as gendered terms) and people have come to confuse this stuff for some sort of broader linguistic canon.

D&amp;D has a long history of taking terms that mean basically the same thing (fairy vs elf, or wizard vs sorcerer) and making them into separate things.

5812,"&gt; And what about the First Law

I have not read the First Law in a long time, and wasn't a fan of it in general so not gonna comment on that.

&gt; ASOIAF ...

Yeah, ASOIAF is a dark series. No one questions that. It's heavy to read and depressing. But it's not ""grimdark"" to me, because these people don't live in a world that has no hope. Facing an imminent apocalypse is not grimdark - that covers like half of all fantasy ever. Bad stuff happens to good characters, yes ... but good people try to fight the good fight. Danaerys is probably the biggest examples? She mostly has pretty noble ambitions of bringing liberty to slaves, even though she's quite the warlord.

Same thing with The Broken Earth. Yeah, people live in a pretty horrible place, but human society endures anyway. It changes, adapts, and they haven't exactly lost themselves. It's a dark trilogy for sure, but far from hopeless.

But that's also kind of my point ... if everything that's depressing is suddenly ""grimdark"", then what books are just ""dark""? I definitely think that ASOIAF has some elements of grimdark, but there are way too many characters who want to do good things with a very realistic chance of succeeding for it to be a grimdark series.",Fantasy

5828,"&gt; many have members who are fully in normal modern society and live generally normal lives outside the community other than the social isolation ext ext

Yes and no. In the beginning, most members will be able to continue to live somewhat normal lives, but as time goes on their entire lives become about the cult. The NXIVM cult is a good example of this. Most members may appear normal to the average person, until actually getting into an in-depth conversation about them, but their lives were entirely about the cult. There was never anything ""logical"" about this cult at all. Like pretty much all cults, their leaders will mould them to attract pretty specific types of people. NXIVM was all bogus from the start, but did well at attracting people who were both very success driven, but also had pretty specific types of insecurities (despite what some member claim). Those who joined eventually made their entire lives about NXIVM. Not only that, in many cases these cults aren't actually that easy for just anyone to join. There is definitely a ""vetting""process in many of them and only particular types of people are invited to join. The investigator who did the CBC NXIVM podcast series, for example, tried to walk into a NXIVM centre to take one of their courses and was turned away, despite claiming a friend sent him. You had to know someone who was already a member just to take a course. There are many different ways that cults use to identify susceptible people. 

Also recommend the podcast called Cults, if you're interested in cults generally btw. Also the whole NXIVM thing is a really engrossing rabbit hole to fall into. Not just the new documentary, but tons and tons of other sources.",Fantasy

5853,"I can't say I agree with your interpretation of the characters in your Dislikes section, some of your interpretations and comparisons (Marcus, for example) seem a bit odd to me. But as with any book what seems unrealistic to some is realistic to others.

&gt; Same applies to Geder whose inclinations to tyranny don't seem to invoke any serious guilt or contemplation in his inner dialogue.

That you see this as unrealistic/unbelievable is odd to me, personally. Without spoiling the end of the series for you, before his rise to power Geder is a character who didn't have much in the way of meaningful human relationships. He was persistently mocked and humiliated by other nobles, and his experiences wound up making him, in turn, a fairly selfish person. He was quite sympathetic in the beginning, as a character frequently being bullied. But because of that, he grew to perceive himself persistently as the victim of everyone else's actions, rather than as having any accountability himself. There were moments early on that hinted he might develop differently, but at the end of the day he was extremely self-centred (directly relevant to how his guilt manifests itself. After his first atrocity, he certainly does appear to feel guilt and does feel haunted, but he absolves himself with the belief that he was given no choice. And like many people who are both self-centred and insecure and in positions of power, he was inclined to throw temper tantrums that had far reaching impacts on other people's lives. He does the things he does partially because he wants to send a message that he won't be mocked...and he seems to think other people do the things they do for their own survival, just to mock him. He doesn't see others as people living their own lives independent of him. It's always about Geder. I've seen several real world politicians like this. Here in Ontario, our Premier Doug Ford is much like this. He took his political grudges and personal feelings out on an entire city. He was pissed off that Toronto repeatedly failed to vote for him as mayor, in addition to other political grievances, bringing in several policies (and reversing several others) simply to get his revenge. He's certainly ruined many ordinary people's lives, and then goes on and expects to be loved by everyone. Donald Trump is another politician who shares quite a few characteristics with Geder. Honestly you see behaviour like this quite a bit in politics, leading certain politicians to introduce or support policies that have severe impacts on normal people's lives, even leading to lose of life. Although Geder himself frankly seems to have somewhat more of a conscience than many politicians. Think there's a lot with this character that Abraham took from the real world. 

I similarly didn't agree with your assessment of Cithrin. What you've defined as not believable as existing in the same person is honestly something I've seen fairly often in people in their 20s, especially their early 20s. Intelligence does not equate emotional maturity.",Fantasy

It's funny but depending on who you read, the ""Middle Ages"" didn't really ""end"" in terms of Feudalism until 1648, but there are actually a few corporations like Stora Enso that are still around today... periodiziation is not a very hard and fast thing and mostly ""the middle ages"" was a fiction created by the ""Enlightenment"" to link themselves closer to the Classical period... people seem to often also equate ""The renaissance"" with the Enlightenment even though the renaissance began in the 12th century and then just basically persisted for 400 years?",Fantasy

The survivors of the Canaan House have an intact and totally healed Gideon body just waiting to be re-ensouled... Imagine what Harrow could do with the body of God's child!

The Edge Chronicles (Stewart and Riddell) - Sky Pirates vs Sky Capitalists, but on the edge of a bottomless cliff. (With illustrations.)

Larklight (Phillip Reeve) - Sir Isaac Newton discovers FTL; space Imperialism ensues. (I'm putting this in because it's space fantasy more than it is science fiction)

Baudolino (Umberto Eco) - Medieval unreliable narrator tells the story of his adoption by Frederick Barbarossa, and later visit to the land of Prester John, to a byzantine official. It's a brilliant mix of historical fantasy with the mind-bending 'high' literature for which Eco is known (Name of the Rose, Foucalt's Pendulum, etc.).

Now for the weird one. By all rights, Senlin Ascends should be a book I love - its premise sounded like it combined the best parts of some of my favourite books (Discworld, The Phantom Tollbooth, and so on), and the first page and blurb amazed me.

* Sorcerer: receives power through magical bloodlines or extraordinary events in youth. In D&amp;D, this is often from having Draconic or Devilish ancestry, or by suffering magical trauma

I choose to use Witch as the feminine counterpart to Wizard, because of my familiarity with fandoms that do such, like Magic the Gathering and Harry Potter. Sorcerer also has a feminine equivalent (i.e. Sorceress), but I personally use Sorcerer and Warlock as gender neutral terms.

5929,"Though I appreciate what you’re saying and am enjoying the discussion, I disagree. When I read ASOIAF, and take them just as an incomplete set of novels, there certainly doesn’t seem to be much hope of a redemptive ending.

Tyrion, one of the more sympathetic characters and whose character arc is one of the big sources of the hope you mention, &gt;!does, after all murder his own father while he’s taking a shit!&lt; and Arya, another source of hope &gt;!joins a cult of murderers in order to escape a life of destitution!&lt; . Jon Snow &gt;!chooses duty over love, getting his lover killed as a result; he is eventually murdered by his own underlings!&lt;. Stannis is another ‘good’ character who believes in duty and honor and doing the right thing — what becomes of him? While some characters have hope and honor, this is a liability in the world of ASOIAF, which, back when the novels were fresh, was an inversion of genre tropes. Also, IIRC &gt;!the world is poised at the precipice of cataclysm in the most recently published book — yes, you can see the dragons coming from a long way off but dealing with the Others is not portrayed as an easily surmountable obstacle!&lt;

And what about the First Law, grimdark *par excellence?* &gt;!Logan’s desire to redeem himself seems, for much of the books, to have a pretty good chance of succeeding. While we’re on the subject and in this spoiler tag, I’ll say that if I knew for sure nothing would work out in the First Law books, I would definitely not have enjoyed them as much!&lt; —  expectations can’t be frustrated if they’re not there to begin with.

The larger thrust of my argument is that the Broken Earth trilogy meets the requirements of a reasonable definition of grimdark:

 &gt;!The central question in the series is whether or not murdering thousands of people directly (and millions indirectly) is a cost worth paying to remake society. There are good people in the books, but they do bad things — we’re forced as readers to decide if the ends (which are far from certain) justify those means. This alone is a bleak moral dilemma that fits the grimdark bill quite well. Further, in many other fantasy novels, a similar situation plays out but it’s the villain trying to remake society through cataclysm — this inversion of Bad Guy vs. Good Guy dynamics is another defining characteristic of grimdark as I see it (see also: Bayaz). I unfortunately don’t have the time here to get into the other dark and grim elements of the world building, plot, or characters of the Broken Earth, but I think this broad summary helps convey what I’m trying to say!&lt;",Fantasy

You should truly read on warrior traditions, more than on weapons and armour. You've a skewed idea of what it is to be a knight. For now, Matt beating two knights was contrived. But if you like it, go ahead! But all this rationalising around the topic is childish. Eluding the actual discussion is childish. Insulting me is childish.

Worth bearing in mind though that outside of a handful of authors and works, there's always been a fair bit of debate over what 'New Weird' is or was. The preface to *The Weird* anthology touches on this but there's a good essay about the subject in Big Echo: [Nothing Beside Remains: A History of the New Weird] (http://www.bigecho.org/nothing-beside-remains). 

It's worth looking over as it has a lot of verbatim quotes from the likes of Harrison, Swainston, Vandermeer and Mieville, often in pretty sharp and acidic disagreement about seemingly fundamental questions: was it a movement or a marketing gimmick, or one co-opted as another? A sub-genre or a mode or just a sensibility? Was it simply New Wave SF come again? Was it particularly British? Where were its boundaries? Was it even a going concern after a few years' efflorescence? Is it a useful way to talk about works outside of a set of dates?

6032,"This square is probably the one where I could fit almost any book, because I laugh a lot and sometimes the simplest things can make me laugh. 

For my bingo card I am probably going to put the **Murderbot** books here ( me and a LOT of other people), because they really are some of my favourite books at the moment and so am so happy to have found them. As a very shy person who has trouble interacting sometimes it's insane how much I relate to Murderbot and not knowing anything going in I was surprised by how optimistic these books were they were honestly some perfect comfort reads! Can't wait for more. 
Off the top of my head the Murderbot books would fit the Ace/Aro squares, optimistic, exploration, BDO ( definitely for the first one, can't remember for sure for the others) , probably more squares I am forgetting. 

Of the other books I read this year that would fit for me:
- **Gideon** and **Harrow the Ninth**  - it's crazy how the books that probably had the saddest, most bittersweet scenes for me and broke me emotionally a couple of times also are the most hilarious ones I read this year! Gideon's humour isn't for everyone I would venture, but these books are absolutely amazing and may well become my favourite trilogy ( depending on how the third one finishes the story) . Harrow the Ninth is the most confused I have been reading a book in a long while, but the payoff was so absolutely worth it ( though it did give me a hell of a lot of other things to be confused about). Can't recommend these enough! 
As for other squares I'd go with necromancer ( hard mode for Harrow), featuring ghosts, exploration ( more so for Gideon), published in 2020 ( for Harrow obviously), probably a couple I am missing ( I think you might be able to argue BDO for Gideon)
**
Howl's Moving Castle** this is just a lovely, beautiful, feel-good read! Was great to read when I was kinda depressed over the pandemic! Recommend it for sure

**Wheel of Time**  - ok so I am aware that humour is not exactly the first thing that comes to mind when discussing Wheel of Time, but the truth is I do end up laughing a LOT, especially in Mat's chapters! So it does technically fit in the square for me. I read the last 4 books this year's after starting the series in the Summer last year. It was a great read, challenging at times ( the slog is real), and the books are definitely not perfect, but I did enjoy them, I thought the whole thing payed off and the series as a whole is one of my favourites now. 

I think these are pretty much all the books I could fit in the square from my reading list this year! Although Kings of The Wyld and Red Sister are on the top of my tbr and based on reviews I am guessing they would fit as well!",Fantasy

6051,"&gt; My issue is that there is a set up that there are strong limits on what Luxin can do and how Chromats can establish their mastery of those nuances over time and with practice. This makes little sense to me for two reasons: drafters have a finite amount of time they are allowed to draft, so in practice they need to get good really fast or they will not know their limits and break their halo...that’s kinda the whole purpose of the chromeria. 

I'm a little fuzzy on the details of what was in book 1 as opposed to later books, so this might be slight spoilers, but..  

That's the whole point! It's the main conflict in the setting. We are told that drafters who break their halo ""go mad"" and need to be killed like rabid animals, but is it objectively true or is it just a power play by the leading drafter organization in order to eliminate all competition? Yes, some of the folks who go over the edge do seem to be a little, or a lot, unhinged. But it is an inevitability or just a result of being persecuted, a lack of culture and guidance on how to handle the transition? Is there perhaps a more significant reason than personal code of honor that causes Gavin to go out of his way to personally hunt color wights?   

All of these questions are examined in later books, and while I can't say that the author completely nailed all of the answers in this regard, at least the ideas make a decent amount of sense in most cases.   

&gt; But by the end of the book we see a literal army of drafters raised by the color prince (somehow he gathered all of these drafters in just the one area, so apparently a large portion of the population are drafters which presents all kinds of logical problems with the Chromeria being the one consolidated branch of drafting school).

How does the Chromeria find out about more or less any drafter? Spoilers, they do have some tools, but those tools are very much imprecise and obscure, so it's very easy to imagine how a lot of people can slip through their grasp.   

On top of that, Chromeria is a very recent institution, iirc it's about 300 years old or so at the time of the narration? Before it, every satrapy had its own tradition of drafting and its own schools for millennia. It's not easy to eradicate all of that, and not that Chromeria tried too much, because its actual power is very limited and largely political in nature.  

And this is without even going into the various rogue factions that haven't been introduced in book 1 yet so I won't be going into the spoiler territory.  

&gt; I don’t know if my first point made much sense but basically the whole premise of drafting is I’ll defined.

In general I tend to more agree than disagree, but not for the reasons you listed.   

&gt; The second is wth is up with Kip going from a nobody to a savant drafter with extreme raw limitless power(depending on what the plot calls for) over the course of one book.

He didn't, he is very much unskilled by the end of book 1. However, his accelerated training did look more than a little implausible.  

That said, the author does try to rationalize it later. It's not a terribly great rationalization.  

&gt; I get that he’s “of the bloodline” and all that trope but that just went from zero to fifty out of nowhere.

 older armor used for practical battle situations was even worse since it included padding and chain or ring mail to cover the open spots. there was a reason knights were mounted. and there was a reason polearms existed in the first place... to kill knights. poleaxes were used to cleave armor, spikes were used to skewer people in armor hammers were used to strike devastating blows crushing the armor, they were the tanks of their day. they were not invincible (they do not exist today do they?) plenty of source material on how to take a knight in combat dont like wiki? then look up the other myriad of materials out there.",Fantasy

6106,"I've wondered before whether there's an SF&amp;F equivalent of ""Oscar season"", and actually built some data tooling to pull out the raw counts.  Here's the past 5 years of Hugo Novel finalists:

      January - 2 finalists (All the Birds, Six Wakes)
      February - 1 finalist (City in the Middle of the Night)
      March - 4 (Collapsing Empire, NY2140, Light Brigade, A Memory Called Empire)
      April - 2 (Goblin Emperor, Space Opera)
      May - 5 (Middlegame, Too Like the Lightning, Uprooted, Seveneves, Skin Game)
      June - 5 (Dark Between Stars, the three Yoon Ha Lee novels, Trail of Lightning)
      July - 3 (Calculating Stars, Spinning Silver, Record of a Spaceborn Few)
      August - 3 (the three NK Jemisin novels)
      September - 5 (10K Doors, Gideon the Ninth, Death's End, Provenance, Aeronaut's Windlass)
      October - 3 (Ancillary Mercy &amp; Sword, Closed &amp; Common Orbit) 
      November - 1 (Three Body Problem)
      &lt;No Hugo finalists published in December&gt;

I'm not sure that any conclusion can be drawn from that; I'd like to look at how much the figures might be distorted by some months being busier than others in general, for example.  

I do recall reading an interview with a debut author a couple of years ago, and they said they were happy that their book was coming out earlier in the year, as later in the year it might get swamped by bigger name titles.  Not sure to what extent that's genuinely a thing, but there are only 3 books that were published in the second half of the year that were (a) debuts and (b) went on to be a Hugo finalist:

* Gideon the Ninth - had a big promotional push behind it - here's [me complaining on this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ang0ff/review_of_ruin_of_kings_and_its_not_good/) about being sick of all the hype **seven months before it was actually released**
* Three Body Problem - a very atypical finalist, as it only got through due to Marko Kloos dropping out due to Puppy shenanigans
* Ten Thousand Doors - no idea, I don't recall any obvious marketing/hyping campaign behind it, so quite possibly this is/was a completely genuine word-of-mouth success?  I think it has some crossover with the YA market, so perhaps that helps its showing on Goodreads, but wouldn't account for it being a finalist in the regular Hugo (adult) novel category.",Fantasy

6114,"She has a large vocabulary which she uses constantly to its full extent in a very exacting way. To be honest, Wurts herself does a better job of explaining it; 
&gt;There are two ways, (really, more than that, to skin this cat) but I think there are two 'rough' catagories. You can either depict the action and let the reader supply their emotions and fill in the blanks - which is 'easier' to write and doesn't tend to step on toes or run against the grain of the readers' own experience - or you can 'define' the characters emotions and circumstances much more tightly - which forces the readership to step out of their own shoes, and even, step out of their own view point more strongly - to experience another reality different from their comfort zone. For Wars of Light and Shadow, I chose the latter route - and though it can alienate some readers who may want to fight the grain of what the characters are experiencing on the page - it can make the read more intense for those readers who choose to step into the experience and immerse in it, wholly.

​

To reach that intensity of experience, you must immerse the reader into the details - and the deeper the details go, the more the immersion. This is accomplished by tying in all of the senses - sight, sound, smell, touch - with a focus that adds to the mood and also by defining, with a high degree of precision, what the character is feeling at the time. This level of immersion makes the prose very dense, and requires a tighter focus on the readerships' part to take it all in. But the magic happens as the brain slows down and the experience being described becomes more vivid.",Fantasy

6128,"Less so about the story itself (solid indie books with some of the series being great and others just mediocre).  But *The King Henry Tapes* has an interesting frame where some chapters are basically recorded memoirs of an a recently graduated magic school (it is set in modern times) student reflecting on his growth from when he was an early teen who cursed like a sailor with a horrible little man complex.

Then other chapters are memoirs from the same character just decades later when he's an old man and its him reflecting on his time as a post graduate mage and all the crazy era changing stuff he lived through.

Another interesting premise from the story was that the magical school basically gave the students a normal education including the humanities, math, science etc etc.  And wouldn't teach kids actual dangerous magic until the equivalent of university classes.  And even then they still held back a lot of stuff until students basically became graduate students in their mid to late 20's.

6129,"I'll second Kate Elliott, Melanie Rawn, Jacqueline Carey, etc. All great authors.

I'll add in a suggestion for:

* **The Witches of Eileanan** by Kate Forsyth - a cetlic-based other world island which was taken over by an evil sorceress 16 years prior to our story begin. It starts with a clear Chosen One, and then gentle melts away from there. (Warning: the first book does have a rape / torture / mutilation scene that you can skip if you want to as anything mentioned it said again later. I mention it because it comes a little bit out of nowhere). 

* **A Conspiracy of Truths** by Alexandra Rowland - this might be up your alley as well. It's a bit more small scope than traditional epic fantasy, but it's epic in how vast the consequences are from one persons actions. I also really really loved a lot of the fresh takes on the world and characters.

Some other ones to check out:

* The Sevenwater Trilogy by Juliet Marillier

* Exiles by Melanie Rawn (warning: third book has not been written in over 20 years and it might never come out but the other two are well worth the read. Absolutely wonderful world with some ideas you don't see elsewhere).

* Graceling series by Kristin Cashore - this one is a bit more YA (protagonists are teens) but they have to deal with world-ending stuff, and generally YA romances etc. are left out of it. There's some great magic types in here.

* Son Of Avonar by Carol Berg 

* Archangel by Sharon Shinn

6146,"As others have mentioned the Kushiel books are great, one of my favorites. I haven't yet found the time to read the third trilogy, but I reread the first trilogy (Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen, Kushiel's Avatar) every few years. If you are not opposed to the sexual themes, they are a fanatastic read.

What I specifically like about the books is that they combine both great political intrigue of feudal courts and globetrotting traveling adventures to far away and exotic places all mixed with a decidedly mysterious and low-fantasy vibe to the magic in the world.

The second trilogy (Kushiel's Scion, Kushiel's Justice, Kushiel's Mercy), while still having some sexual scenes is not nearly as focussed on the whole sexual masochism nature since there is a new main character in those. The first book in the trilogy felt a bit weaker to me, but the second and third are just as good as the first  three. This trilogy is a bit more focussed on adventures to different countries, but the political intrigue, while still existant, takes a bit of a backseat. 

The books are however set in a very european, alternate fantasy-history, with the second trilogy playing partly in England. However England in this books is a lot more inspired by celtic influences and the classic medieval anglo-saxons. Similarly there are big changes to all the countries and religions in this alternate fantasy Europe, with the main characters hailing from basically France, but with a religion that is focussed on love and sexual freedom and Germany for example being a lot closer to a mix of the barbarian Germans of antiquity and vikings.",Fantasy

There may be lesser-known instances of plantation slaves but whenever I hear the word plantation it's immediately evocative of the USs history with slavery. For example, if someone said to you, free of context, 'I went to visit a plantation' what do you immediately imagine?

Also the general construct is quite specific to that time. A noble living in a large estate with personal slaves working their plantation is very different from feudal slavery models such as indentured serfdom. Not to mention the inherent racial element. Many of history's enslaved peoples were not so focussed on race, but rather opportunity.

The piece you've quoted there is definitely an excellent example of one of the moments where Sanderson is directly engaging with the topic and doing a great job of showing the reader where his stance on the matter is.

It's passages like this that assure me he absolutely made this series to deliberately engage with, and confront, the topic of slavery.

Or the author could just leave the story where it ended with the first generation. 
After all, the series that I used as examples come in at the end of the story rather than the beginning and either ultimately defeat the antagonist or acknowledge that this ultimate evil can never be defeated but must be met and beaten back by each new generation.

I'm not playing a semantics game here: there are differences between spy organizations and cults. To me it makes perfect sense for a secret organization with practical goals to want people with practical skills they're good at. If they can't even survive a single assassination attempt, they're clearly not good enough to join you and you've managed to keep your existence secret once more. That's how the Ghostbloods work. Charisma isnt the major recruitment tool for them, they look for ambition, dedication and ruthlessness in new inductees. They rely on people joining out of an internal desire, which they'll fuel on occasion. That's pretty different from real-world cults who actively proselytize to get new members

He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat.

An interesting thing I find in reading books, even more in fantasy, is that you can usually perceive the way the author thinks about a lot of different things. There are usually a lot of little details you can look for, that help you get another view on the world based on characters experiences.

Some stories are good, some are not bad... But they always let you see something in a different light (that may or not be interesting to consider).

6239,"&gt;I don’t know if my first point made much sense but basically the whole premise of drafting is I’ll defined.

It's not.  The color prince is assembling an army of drafters who **don't care about breaking the halo**.  It's basically their mission statement.

&gt;The second is wth is up with Kip going from a nobody to a savant drafter with extreme raw limitless power

He kind of didn't, he went berserk and it has some real ramifications.  I guess I didn't see a lot of what he did as savantism, but I suppose this might be part of the reason why many people didn't like the first book anyway.  The green golem thing basically took a huge chunk out of his halo, I think in the text they explain that he does that 2-3 more times and he's basically fucked.  

&gt;My final problem is that I just didn’t really like any of the characters

I can kind of see that.  I did not like Kip in the first book either, it took me a few for me to like him more.  He does get better over time, which I think is one strength of the series; you don't necessarily need to like every character from the start.  Gavin's story is pretty great though, nearly from the start...  TBP has been widely criticized for its portrayal of women (Karris), which also improves in subsequent books.

I think it's fine that you didn't keep reading though.  I enjoyed the series, but the last book and a half is honestly a giant trainwreck, though for entirely different reasons than your current criticisms which are more or less mostly addressed.",Fantasy

The winternight trilogy by Katherine Arden is an epic written in medieval Russia. It breaks your medieval rule, but it is very far away from your typical medieval epics and is a very refreshing and original tale with magic and creatures from Russian mythology.

I don’t know if one can call Daughter of smoke and bone an epic, but it fits the other criteria, so it may be worth a look.

* **Deryni Chronology** by Katherine Kurtz - 18 books across various trilogies.
* **Realm of the Elderlings** by Robin Hobb - Someone will be along to sing her praises shortly.
* **Inda** by Sherwood Smith - 4 big books chock full of worldbuilding.
* **Kushiel's Legacy** by Jacqueline Carey - This one may not quite be the same feel (it has a more narrow focus) but it really covers a lot of ground. If the sexual elements of the setting don't put you off then I think it's worth considering in this category!
* **An Ember in the Ashes** by Sabaa Tahir - This one doesn't get a lot of attention here because it's YA and I can't recommend it if adolescent romance is a dealbreaker for you. Lots of POVs, magic, and non-western setting tho!
* **The Brightest Shadow** by Sarah Lin - Though there's only one book out until next year it's a huge one and the series is going to be longer.

Naomi Novik's Temeraire series is a long series and is the Napoleonic wars with Dragons as a kind of air force for both sides. The fun part is that later books explore South America, Australia, and Africa, so it isn't only European.

My own writing process is similar to yours, though I’ve only ever published short stories so far. 

I hand write the story. Then I’ll type it and make corrections, small changes along the way, then leave it for a couple weeks to read, relax, whatever. Then I will print and read it. Then read it again to mark it up. Then I will make the changes. 

I’ll let it sit one more time, then send it to my best friend who is an avid reader and also a writer. Then I will mark it up and then when I get his notes back, I compare it to my own and then come up with what I want to change. Then I will let it sit a final time, read it, and if any change is necessary I will make it. Then I submit it.

Kid from a slightly magical land ends up in a secret, VERY magical world.  Lives in a cool magical hotel, has to complete difficult and frightening tasks (the Trials in the title) in order to gain entrance to an elite magical school.

6365,"This is more about setting than premise, but I picked up **Titus Groan** based solely on a description of Gormenghast Castle in *The Dictionary of Imaginary Places* by Alberto Manuel and Gianni Guadalupi. The book describes the castle itself, the landscape it stands in, and gives some idea of the people there and how they live, alluding to characters and events of the story in a detached style that makes it unclear how much is being given away. It's never stated what the book is about or which character(s) the reader follows. The editors did a great job of describing this place and its people in their own way while still taking their cues from the source material in terms of language:

&gt;The castle is so vast that members of the household may not see each other for weeks. The main building consists of several large wings, although the additions and alterations made over the centuries make it almost impossible to trace the ground plan. The result is a bizarre collection of buildings; some, like the pavilions, observatories and galleries, have an obvious use; the purpose of others remains obscure. One curious structure, for instance, is an area entirely packed with pillars that are set so close together that is impossible for a normal man to force his way through them. Another has a stone carving of a huge lion holding the limp corpse of a man in its jaws; the corpse bears the inscription ""He was an enemy of Groan.""
&gt;
&gt;Many of these experiments in architecture are now in a semi-ruinous state, but the most sinister of all is still the Tower of Flints, in the East Wing. The tallest of the many towers of Gormenghast, it is a time-eaten edifice covered with black Ivy and inhabited by death-owls which rises up from the fields of masonry like a mutilated finger pointing blasphemously at heaven. It is associated with the macabre end of Lord Sepulchrave, the 76th Earl of Groan. After a long period of depression, Sepulchrave became convinced that he was a death-owl and began to eat rats which he caught in the subterranean kitchens of the castle. He finally entered the Tower of Flints itself, taking the present of a corpse with him to give to the resident owls, and was torn to pieces by the savage birds.

No idea what the book was actually about, or what the overall tone might be like based on this description - never mind the fantastic but alarming prose the author uses, oh my - I still couldn't resist picking this book up, just based on this. I've always had a weakness for labyrinthine and lonely places, mazes full of mute and watchful ghosts. I was not disappointed.",Fantasy

this is how you train a peasant to kill a knight, simply because of sheer numbers peasants cut knights down. a knight is noble born or is owed a favor from a king and awarded land as a payment (granted nobility) peasants however are in great supply. why do you think calvary were always held in reserve until the battle was all but won, they were sent to finally route the opposing force. they are slow, dismounted they are useless, and they are specifically why polearms were invented. knights took to carrying lances (spears at first) which was very unwieldy and a 1 use weapon to keep those polearms and peasants from killing them. the lance was a poor excuse for a weapon. my history lesson is factual.",Fantasy

6376,"Well, thanks for the lesson, but as a Historian I can tell you this is wrong and something put out by youtube videos and the likes with little rigour and scarce actual knowledge on the matter. Reality is, a peasant is a peasant and must dedicate much of his/her life to farming. Very few were ever known to be good warriors and the warrior class actually emerged out of need precisely because people could not devote a life to farming AND be good warriors. Warrior traditions are not a simple thing in any culture. But all this, and your wonderful and thoughtful explanation is unnecessary. (though I appreciate it dearly). Mat does not beat these guys for any of those reasons but mainly because he is an MC and it seemed cool that he would beat two knights after being a wuss for 2 books. That may be cool for some people, like you. But to me, it felt childish and something I would see in an anime show. 

Now, for those who are hating on me, I actually liked the WOT and I have a special place in my heart for Robert Jordan. It's just that this specific moment seems so immature and ridiculous to me, precisely because it undermines the fact that knights are not just given a sword, plate armour and a horse. They start at 7 and very few become squires. Out of those very few become knights at 21 at best... so. I don't know. Peasants with polearms are hardly what kept the armies at Tours at bay. And yes, the romanticisation of these vents did happen, but there's little to no proof of this. And a few examples (because there are), do not demonstrate that peasants with sticks were better than armed men with steel.

The voters in the Hugo awards tend to be people who are actively invested in the genre and how its boundaries are being pushed, moving beyond being interested in the most popular SFF works. Popularity is not a guarantee of being granted awards for being good literature. Also, I have no idea what you're talking about regarding it not being considered fantasy? Magic is literally one of the core aspects of The Broken Earth in the orogenes.

Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive has never won a Hugo (though it was nominated), but it was still voted number one in last year's top novels poll due to its popularity on the subreddit. The same people voting for Sanderson and the other top voted novels are all a part of this same community which voted Jemisin to #14, which is a fairly large achievement given that it's top novels of all time for our users. 

Who are all of the hordes of people who somehow came out of the woodworks to vote in both r/Fantasy top novels poll and in the Hugos who are somehow not real fantasy readers? I don't understand where you think these people are coming from. How did they get here to vote in our poll? How did they even find out about Worldcon?

There are the trappings of the usual fantasy cult in my book--black robes and masks and blatant evil stuff--but I actually try to combine that with modern day high control groups and the tactics they use to control people's lives.

I have some experience with these kind of groups in real life. There's the BITE model they use, if you've ever heard of that. Behavior control, information control, thought control, emotional control. At the beginning, these cults only show you the good stuff they do, the nice side, and slowly, over time, they obtain more psychological control over the new member. They use the BITE model, and isolate the member, restrict outside information, and cut them off from family, and make it so they HAVE to rely on the cult to go about life, so that then excommunication becomes a huge deal, not a little deal.

And then yeah there's crazy fantasy horrific stuff at the very top of the cult lol. But yeah, I find cults fascinating, and so I centered my latest book around them. The city it takes place in is called The City of a Thousand Cults, and there's hundreds of different religions and cults that all live in the city.",Fantasy

It feels that way because the moment Baru leaves her childhood behind she also leave her own soul behind, it's somewhat of a recurring theme within the book itself as well.

They feature the struggle for balance between chaos and order. A lot of the later chronological books feature The Legend ... Of the women of Westwind. This book is about 400 years into the chronology and a space cruiser crashes from a battle and the crew seek refuge in the high pass of Westwind ... Where the cold weather is more like their home.

6440,"I think **The Realm of the Elderlings** books by Robin Hobb might be a good fit. Some of these books get up to 35+ hours long on audio, especially deeper in the series. They're fairly popular here, solid epic fantasy and interesting characters. They're split into multiple trilogies, with characters popping in and out so it's definitely a world you can immerse yourself in for a while

There's the **Kingkiller Chronicles**  by Patrick Rothfuss, they definitely fit your long hours request, although be warned it's been almost a decade and the third book has yet to be release, which can be a dealbreaker for some.

**The Priory of the Orange Tree** by Samantha Shannon is another long one, it's stand alone but its a sweeping epic, highlights are the characters, plot is a bit rushed in places, probably should've been two books but overall I enjoyed it.

**Founder's Series** by Robert  Jackson Bennett. These are around 20ish hours if I remember correctly. It's a newer series, so there's only 2 books at the moment, but it's one of my favorites, quality all around (characters, plot, world-building, etc.). His **Divine Cities** series is also very good, and I'm fairly certain those books are 20ish hours as well.

**The Riftwar Saga** and related series by Raymond Feist. There's a bunch of these books, all interconnected series, so you can definitely get immersed here. I read these, but I looked up the first 5 or so and they seem to run around 20 hours. It's been a while since I read them, but I remember some being better than others, although the first two were good imo and **The Empire Triology** is generally highly rated on this sub.

You could maybe try **The Books of Babel** by Josiah Bancroft, they hover around 15 hours but it is a really interesting worldbuilding, and while the first book takes a while to get off the ground imo once you get past that it picks up pace and the characters (both main and secondary) get much more interesting.

Anything by **NK Jemisin**. Her books run 10-20 hours depending, so idk if that's too short, but she writes beautifully. Complex characters, intense plots, really interesting worlds/magic, and in general gives you a lot to think about. I recommend her all the time, she's one of my favorite authors. 

And just personal favs: two series that I really enjoyed the audiobooks of are **Alex Verus** by Bennedict Jacka and **Thursday Next** by Jasper Fforde. They are 7-10 books, and enjoyable to escape to for a while, and both are nice breath of fresh air from longer epics. Unfortunately, the books themselves hover more 10-15 hours, which is more standard for urban/alternate fantasy, so I'm not sure if they're what you want, but I'm adding them just because I regularly revisit both of them in audiobook form.",Fantasy

6444,"Kay is known for his beautiful prose and being able to stir emotion. 

He got his start when he helped Christopher Tolkein compile JRR's notes to write the Silmarillion. Then he went off and got his law degree before doing some writing for TV. He didn't publish his first fantasy until the late 80s ... A portal fantasy laced with themes from norse and Arthurian mythology.

After that he tilted toward fantasy that has an alternate history feel. It started with a fantasy called Tigana that has a feel of renaissance italy. Followed by A Song for Arbonne which was sort of a cross between the Albigensian Crusade and Eleanor of Aquitaine's court of love.

Since then all of his books have been set in the same world. An alternate version of ours depicting real events, with the names changed and a fantasy twist. He calls it history with a turn to the left. He focuses less on the primary players of these events and more in the figures that surround them.

The Sarantine Mosaic is about Justinian Constantinople

6452,"Syl is one of Sanderson's whimsical characters that doesn't sit right with me. 

I call out my own religion to at least signal my personal bias in this regard. Any storyline that involves prophecies, portents, and visions fall flat for me. Dalinar's visions in the High Storms make no illusion that they are true. There is no risk that what Dalinar saw is false. If there was an actual risk they were true and Dalinar truly mad, I would find them interesting. But, they aren't. 

The ending infuriates me because of the message it sends. If it included a lot of other information, I would be fine. But, the narration specifically calls out Sazed specifically draws from religious sources and nothing else. Elevates the religious sources above all other sources by calling specific attention to them in the narration. 

There is a way to gain Mistborn Magic artificially, but it is completely unavailable and unknown to most of the population so it might as well not exist in the context of the narrative because...it never comes into play. It might come into play in the third trilogy, but as it stands, it doesn't.

Even if it was coopted by the religion, in the context of the story there is no counter to it. The implicit message it sends is clear to me.

I don't want censorship, I want people to think critically about what they're creating. I don't know how I'm messing up expressing this to you. Write what you want but do think about it first.

I am a writer, I deal with tricky subjects all the time. I am going to write these stories, but I am still going to be cautious with how I portray the topics. I am going to add scenes and rewrite scenes and cut scenes until I get something I am personally comfortable with the world seeing. My fear of morons taking a fictional show as an example will hopefully lead to a book that caused society to progress. It will also probably make for a better more entertaining story. 

And then there are stories that I don't intend to be progressive. I'm still going to make sure I'm not encouraging abuse victims to say in abusive relationships, or telling minorities its wrong to be minorities. I'm still going to write the story, just going to be careful how I portray things.

For me personally it was a great book. I loved the characters and was very invested in their story, liked the relationships ( which is something that I often have trouble connecting with) and the world building and the reveals. 
I pretty quickly got into the plot so I didn't really feel how enormous this book was. 
As a whole I really enjoyed the story and would definitely consider re-reading it and I'd recommend it. 

That being said the book is not perfect and while it worked for me, I can definitely see how it wouldn't appeal to everyone - the action took a while to get going ( I was living the world building and characters so I was ok with it) and it is a fairly long book, but the ending still manages to be somewhat rushed ( it works fine, but since we took so long with certain aspects, I would've maybe liked more time spent on it).

They literally had people whose job titles were ""Quest designer"", and they made entire storylines out of some of these quests, which couldn't just be completed by following a flashing light, or clicking on the glowy dot on the minimap- you had to actually read the damn things, and figure out what some of them meant, and go where you knew you could find the people and items, and solve puzzles that ranged from fairly simple clues, like finding a bunch of in-game items from all across the world, to figuring out how to navigate a shanty town in a vampire-infested hellhole, to figuring out how to work ancient machinery in order to make some very cool new armour types.",Fantasy

6528,"Well, there appears to be a blonde beside the punk elf under the trolls armpit, but sadly she is obscured by the slavic style orc in the tracksuit and not gracing us with a seductive pose or a nice view of a shapely behind.

6529,"These are of course your opinions, everybody takes away something different, but I wanted to respond to a few of these:

1. I can’t speak for all the instances you’re thinking of, as I haven’t read the entire Cosmere just yet (Just SA, Mistborn, and the first Wax &amp; Wayne book), but I thought that at least in the case of &gt;!Adolin and Shallan!&lt; it was pretty charming. A lot of romances in Sanderson’s stories feel very refreshing actually. This is probably at least partly because I’m not a fan of a lot of the romance conflicts (and just romance plots period frankly) I read in other fantasy. 

I love the scene when &gt;!Shallan finds out about Jasnah’s tentative plans!&lt;. An unorthodox but positive start and they also just happen to enjoy each other’s company. (Also &gt;!Dalinar’s arc!&lt; is like reverse this)

2. I think the point was that he was completely alone, the lowest he could possibly be inside and out. The &gt;!spren is basically a part of him, but he stopped because she expended a huge amount of energy in an innocent attempt to help, however misguided. And also, this was a situation where death may very well have been preferable (and was for many).!&lt;

3. I honestly can’t tell you how much I disagree! As a total agnostic, funnily enough, the end of Hero of Ages was and still is one of my favorite endings ever. &gt;!All of Sazed’s peers consider him an eccentric, and his chosen subject is basically ignored by every person he tries to explain it to, it’s not seen as a worthy subject. But the reason it’s perfect for when he gains the powers of the Shards is because of the breadth of his knowledge, not the depth. !&lt;

Religion is the way many people and peoples interpret the world around them, and each culture values different things. &gt;!Another Keeper that focused on biology might have been able to focus on all the minutia of life but might not have been able to navigate the night sky! His true strength is that he holds all the qualities of nature and especially humanity in equal value. !&lt;

The reason I love this ending is because it’s the simultaneous culmination and validation of his life. &gt;!The Mistborn trilogy is as much about Sazed’s loss of faith as it is about Vin.!&lt;

4. This really is an opinion-based thing more than anything else. I personally enjoy how his characters have both powers and responsibility thrust upon them whether they like it or not. A huge amount of the conflict is on how they struggle with the things they can’t change.

6538,"So my TBR is empty and ready for tomorrow's commute. Audiobook's only however, I really try and focus on 25+ hours or longer books for both financial efficiency and that I love the longer and heavier reads to really get immersed for ages in. I do love trying new sub genres and branching out within the fantasy bubble, so i'm not looking for books that are heavily close to my current loves, just giving an idea of what styles i like. Good characters really draw me in and a book can be lacking in nearly every other area, but if the characters are done well i'll probably still enjoy it. Preference for series so I don't need to go recommendation hunting as often.

My pinnacle list, all have been my ""favorite book of all time"" while reading it and I will likely re-read these constantly in the future.

* First Law by Joe Abercrombie
* Gentlemen Bastards by Scott Lynch
* Powdermage by Brian McClellan
* Super Powereds by Drew Hayes
* Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson
* Stormlight by Brandon Sanderson
* Rage of Dragons by Evan Winters
* Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir

My average list, books that I read and enjoyed myself with, but will not touch again and that I barely look back on

* ASoIaF by G.R.R.M
* Inheritance Trilogy by Christopher Paolini (90% nostalgia, never forget your first)
* Harry Potter by J.K Rowling
* Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson
* Chronicles of Pern by Anne McCathrey
* Gods of Blood and Powder by Brian McClellan

DNF List and lessons learned

* Memory, Sorrow and Thorn by Tad Williams - Audiobook had ambiance sounds and soft music playing the entire time, broke immersion and made it super annoying to listen to.
* Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan - Made it to 9 before quitting, so little happened and I couldn't tell the difference between each book they felt more like drawn out chapters. Also hated the male-female interactions and Ta'Veren/prophecy, anything that takes away from something being earned or logical.
* Lightbringer by Brent Weeks - Quit mid book 2 and probably would've finished the series if it weren't for Kip. The Gavin story and world were super interesting, but the Kip parts were so... masturbatory that the entire book just felt like the author trying to give all the kids who grew up fat a massive erotica porn story.
* Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir - Apparently I cannot stand second person, dear lord did that stop me from enjoying things.
* The Stand by Stephen King - Not technically a DNF but I may or may not continue. One of the best atmospheres and world building I've ever read by a large margin, but with zero connection to the characters and plot, I'm forcing myself for each chapter.",Fantasy

The salient point in my comments in the above thread is really about the futility of the characters efforts.  Despite their attempts at redemption or good works, the world is dark, the future is grim, and the bad guys win.  Futility and nihilism.  That is Grimdark.

As I said in the example using **The First Law**:  “There is zero redemption for &gt;!Jezal!&lt; as well - despite his best effort - and book three ends with &gt;!him rather helpless and somewhat pathetic - unable to wield any real Power despite being king.!&lt;  And then top that off with the beautiful irony of &gt;!Logen ending the book in the exact same way as the series started.!&lt;  Now THAT is textbook Grimdark at its finest.

6634,auuuugh I need the recipeeeeee!!!,Fantasy
6635,"&gt; The first is that grimdark describes a story where the storyline is bleak and there's no hope 

This is the definition that actual authors of grimdark use.   This is the ""real"" definition, as far as that can be claimed.  

Joe Abercrombie, for example, (""Lord Grimdark"" himself)  has often talked about how for him the essence of the genre is nihilism.  He's said ""Life is basically shit"" in more than once interview.   

This is a running theme in his books.  People are shit, nothing will ever get better because they'll always fuck it up   Etc etc,  Cynicism, Nihilism. 

That's what distinguishes the genre from others, that embrace of nihilism. 

&gt;\&gt; the second describes it as a story that features a lot of violence 

This second one useless because it also basically describes every single fantasy story.     ""lots of violence""  doesn't distinguish it from anything that came before. 

So, in short, use the definition that actually distinguishes it.   

Cynicism, Nihilism, No Hope = Grimdark

Lots of violence  =  Could be any genre.",Fantasy

Spoilers are story giveaways by someone else before you read the story, before the author intended you to know. 

When you start a new chapter, you're actually reading the story already.   There's no spoiling possible.   You're in the act.    The author intends for you to know whatever it is is contained in the chapter header.

Slaves have always worked in plantations and fields. Agriculture has been the main occupation for people until after the Middle Ages, and slaves were a cheap workforce.

Even that is not really that different from slavery in other countries and time periods.

All that being said, it is on kindle unlimited (all 3 soon to be 4 books), so if you have it, I would highly recommend picking it up again especially if your qualms were on the worldbuilding issues / lacking enough spark of fantasy as the second book definitely fleshes out the world quite well.",Fantasy

The ""problem"" with the Syl helping Kaladin is only related to religion. Spren are not actually angels as you define them: this should be obvious at least from Oathbringer. But why should your religion matter in a fantasy setting?

I don't find the ending of Hero of Ages problematic at all. Sazed is not only knowledgeable about religions, so even if his changes are made based on religion... What's the matter?
Mistborn era 2 does talk about the changes made, and not all is good and well. More than that, but here I may remember wrongly, the power Sazed did have was not absolute in a sense he needed to know every detail to make everything work: that's obvious from genetic changes made by the Lord Ruler before.

About Genetic Magic System, where is it?
Stormlight has spirits which bond with people through oath. Elantris has a kind of random choosing unrelated to ascendancy, which allows to use runic magic. Warbreaker has a donation type of magic, where the user can donate, receive and use breaths.
mistborn has actually the kind of hereditary system you mention, but (I may be wrong) Mistings are not completely hereditary. There's at least a method to become a Mistborn artificially.


For the Rithmatist, again what's the problem?
You get a short (relatively) book with a concentrated setting... So the religious ritual may not be the only way to access magic. And again, even if there is a need for a specific religion? You are in a fantasy setting after all.

Sting is badass, Kyle McLaughlin is just fun, the guild navigator is crazy, and the soundtrack is awesome. It's a wild ride for sure, but it's one of my favorites.

Edit:
 I should also mention that I love the book (it's one of my favorite books, all-time). I think you just have to view the movie as a totally seperate thing. Herbert's time and attention into the world and the characters of Dune is quite incredible. I think it's near impossible to replicate that experience in a movie.

6742,"he has been trained in the staff since he was old enough to hold a staff. thats formal training. when knights were the be all end all guess what toppled them? a simple polearm in the hands of a peasant army. 

the quarterstaff is a weapon grasped at the middle and halfway to the end or 1/4 of the way from the end (thus the name) and is at least 6 ft amd up to 9 ft in length. thats a minimum of a 3 ft strike range along with the potential to parry or attack twice with each strike. a typical longsword (european has between 32 and 43 inches in length and its terribly slow in comparison) (japanese swords namely the katana and the wakazashi were 2 ft and less respectively sharp on a concave side) the latter being what is mostly used in WoT. so from the length alone there is a foot of reach from a quarterstaff. thats a whole lot in a fight.

 think of the roman phalanx in this regard : they fought with spears and shields with simple thrusts, only after their spears were broken or thrown did they switch to their gladius (a shortsword meant for slashing and thrusting attacks). when they did this the phalanx broke and it was used primarily to drive enemies away after their ranks broke. typically they faced sword and shield wielders. reach is a big thing. i know a spear is not a staff and their uses are different.

Fall of the Black Seraph
For fans of Reincarnation, Second Chances, Time-Loops, Tower Climbs, and Dark Fantasy.

(The Complete Genesis Game Collection)

Available on Amazon and Kindle Unlimited
Humanity was nearly destroyed when the apocalypse arrived, heralded by the appearance of the World Dungeon and the system of power it provided.  No one gained more power than the brutal tyrant known as the Black Seraph. 
 
Achieving victory at the cost of humanity, Seraph was the only survivor. Cursed by the immortal Amarath for his crimes, Seraph was cast back to the past into his childhood body, his powers locked away until he repents.
But people do not change overnight...
And atonement never comes easy.
Can Seraph rediscover his humanity in time to save them all from the coming of Wormwood?

This story contains morally ambiguous situations that some readers will find offensive, IE casual violence and ruthlessness. Does not contain harem elements or sexual content. YMMV.

The reason vaccines would solve the problem of overpopulation is because they lower childhood mortality, and therefore people wouldn't feel the need to have so many children. It's amazing how Americans managed to turn this simple logic into a medical conspiracy.

I think (and a good chunk of the community backs me up on this), that she thoroughly deserved those awards on her own merit, because she wrote some absolutely incredible books, but that there's a large chunk of the population who is unwilling to accept them out of either outright or implicit bias. There's a segment of the community who are excited by new voices and new perspectives, and a segment who wants the same tropes retreaded over and over. 

Also, whenever someone suggests that she won those awards because of 'affirmative action,' I have to post this chunk of her acceptance speech.

""But this is the year in which I get to smile at all of those naysayers—every single mediocre insecure wannabe who fixes their mouth to suggest that I do not belong on this stage, that people like me cannot possibly have earned such an honor, that when they win it it’s meritocracy but when we win it it’s “identity politics” — I get to smile at those people, and lift a massive, shining, rocket-shaped middle finger in their direction.""",Fantasy

It was that adaption that made me a fan of Dune and it holds a special place in my heart. The TV movies were much closer to the books, but i do not like them much.

I know a couple Dune fans that don't like it because of the Wyrding modules... but i actually think the Wyrding Modules was a great idea. It would have been way to much information dump to try to explain in a 2 hour movie why the Fremen were equal/superior to the Sardaukar.

2. Explanation of the Mad King, Dance of Dragons and even earlier show how time is cyclical sometimes with the Targaryans. 

3. Explanation as to who the three eyed crow/raven is (and the fact that he’s almost 200 years old). 

4. Maester Aemon giving background on Dunc and Egg and how their story affects the present.  

5. The ENTIRE Robert’s Rebellion, while decades prior is the reason why the events in real time even exist.

And the fact that not only Alex, but the Houses at large, basically play with forces they don't fully understand is the very premise of the book, so it makes sense that there's isn't an in-depth presentation of how things work from the start.

Earth's last great civilization was wiped out long ago, the world it left behind is a weird mess at best, and two young women find themselves grappling with the achievements and failures of ancestors they know nothing about.

Isavel is desperate to do the right thing, blessed by her gods as she appears to be, yet she is repeatedly robbed of everything she holds dear and finds herself pushed more and more towards becoming a weapon. But a weapon for what? Meanwhile, exiled heretic Ada is driven by a ferocious and sometimes catastrophically reckless hunger for knowledge, pushed to rummage through the remains of elder powers to try and fix a world she believes is in need of healing.

Their lives intersect and intertwine in increasingly strange and powerful ways, under the old and watchful eyes of the stars themselves.

* **Novel Featuring Exploration** (Books 1-6, to varying extents)
* **Self-Published SFF Novel** (Books 2-6, Hard Mode. Book 1, not hard mode)
* **Novel by a Canadian Author** (Books 1-6, Hard Mode)
* **Novel with a Number in the Title** (Books 1-5 - do you recognize the terrible programming wink-wink?)
* **Novel with a Magical Pet** (Book 5 &amp; possibly 6. In Books 3, 4, and 6 the entities in question don't *act* as much like pets, but in Book 6 there's talking, so maybe Hard Mode?)
* I should specify that the series contains beings referred to as ""ghosts"" that are almost certainly not ghosts in the sense meant by the Bingo square, sadly.

6859,"I just published She Courts Darkness, book 2 of my series. It's $2.99, or free on Kindle Unlimited. Clocks in around 90k words.

https://www.amazon.com/She-Courts-Darkness-Bartrams-Book-ebook/dp/B08K3R7MWH/

The blurb:

Six months after helping win a bloody revolution, mercenaries Victoria Belltower and Samantha Redwyne find themselves working freelance on the road. But old ties are hard to break. They receive a letter from their former employer with dire news: Punkin—friend, thief, and strange young woman—is missing.

Cryptic clues lead Victoria and Samantha to the bustling desert city of Al-Haumarune, where they learn there is more to Punkin's past life than she ever let on. The city has unsettling secrets, with stories of disappearing people, knives in the shadows, and a sinister group gathering power behind the scenes. There's a darkness in the City of a Thousand Cults, and if Victoria wants to find her missing friend, she'll have to embrace it—and face the darkness in the mirror as well.

***

It's an action/adventure/mystery type fantasy novel. This one really focuses in on the concept of cults, and I wanted to marry the ideas of those ancient fantasy style, black robe wearing cults and modern day high control cult groups. I have some personal experience with the area and cults are just fascinating to me, how they control people, etc.

Content warning for violence and an adult situation here or there. Think Joe Abercrombie level of rating, so if you're not into fantasy novels with violence and whatnot this would not be for you.

Technically the story does stand alone, as it's a whole different plot and problem from the first book, but the characters are the same and it'd be a ton more enjoyable if you read the first book first so you know who these people are. That one is called She Topples Giants, found here:

https://www.amazon.com/She-Topples-Giants-Morgan-Stang-ebook/dp/B086873JD7/

This one's about a town revolution and a big ol' sword-wieldin' lady mercenary who gets caught up in all the drama and action. Some review snippets:

""I went into this blind with the sample, and was immediately drawn in and would recommend you skip the reviews (this included) and do the same. The sample is long enough, and strong enough to make its own recommendations.""

""This is easily one of the best books I have read this year. There is nothing that would give this away as a self-published debut...""

""I felt plot developments and twists were foreshadowed exactly the right amount. Whilst I was blindsided by the exact way events unfolded in many cases, nothing happened with no warning at all and there was a good balance between feeling smug that you were right, and being shocked by how wrong you were.""

""This book surprised me. In the first half I was a bit letdown, as the pace was slow and there was an innocence and humor that didn't fit the description. But then, shit hit the fan and the story took off, and thoroughly enjoyed it, even made me enjoy the slow pace before hand.""",Fantasy
6860,"From A Feast For Crows:

&gt;”—may sit the Seastone Chair, aye."" Euron glanced about the tent. ""As it happens I have oft sat upon the Seastone Chair of late. It raises no objections."" His smiling eye was glittering. ""Who knows more of gods than I? Horse gods and fire gods, gods made of gold with gemstone eyes, gods carved of cedar wood, gods chiseled into mountains, gods of empty air . . . I know them all. I have seen their peoples garland them with flowers, and shed the blood of goats and bulls and children in their names. And I have heard the prayers, in half a hundred tongues. Cure my withered leg, make the maiden love me, grant me a healthy son. Save me, succor me, make me wealthy . . . protect me! Protect me from mine enemies, protect me from the darkness, protect me from the crabs inside my belly, from the horselords, from the slavers, from the sellswords at my door. Protect me from the Silence."" He laughed. ""Godless? Why, Aeron, I am the godliest man ever to raise sail! You serve one god, Damphair, but I have served ten thousand. From Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray.""   

Also from the same book: 

&gt;	The door to the inn banged open. Willow stepped out into the rain, a crossbow in her hands. The girl was shouting at the riders, but a clap of thunder rolled across the yard, drowning out her words. As it faded, Brienne heard the man in the Hound’s helm say, “Loose a quarrel at me and I’ll shove that crossbow up your cunt and fuck you with it. Then I’ll pop your fucking eyes out and make you eat them.” The fury in the man’s voice drove Willow back a step, trembling.    
Seven, Brienne thought again, despairing. She had no chance against seven, she knew. No chance, and no choice.     
She stepped out into the rain, Oathkeeper in hand. “Leave her be. If you want to rape someone, try me.”",Fantasy

Because of the limits of special effects at the time lots of scifi /fantasy/comic stories had odd or weird or just plain terrible adaptions into films and TV.

I've mentioned repeatedly here that the problematic elements relate to race and slavery in the abstract but that it's especially of note because of the cultural context in which the work was created. Racism and the memory of slavery is still very prominent in the American zeitgeist. How could I talk about this work and it's implications without mentioning it?

Yes, Lynch took a lot of liberties and deviated from the book, either because they tried to fit it all into one movie and made adjustments or Lynch's own ego got in the way.

6899,"I thought the trailer wasn't very good at all. It all looked so... market researched generic blah. The costumes, the aesthetic. It was just all so... safe. It was generic military scifi #23, rather than dune. To me.


Then I found out they were gender bending one of the characters. Didn't make sense. Apparently there weren't enough women in the story. 


If they wanted more women, perhaps they should've chosen to adapt any of the myriad and wonderful books that are written with women or by women or both at the same time rather than just arbitrarily changing characters. I already got burned by that recently in a musical I attended so I'm soured on the whole thing. 


Finally, the soundtrack. I love pink floyd but again that distorted female vocal remix that is every fucking trailer nowadays? Ehh.. not feeling curious. 


Overall it looks like it has nothing interesting from the visual perspective, which is a shame since dune offers a lot of space for experimentation. I miss the old late 80s and 90s movies that were not afraid to have some interesting costuming. I mean just look at the fremen in the trailer. Those people live in the still suits, yet we aren't shown ANY personalization? 


But wait, maybe they're doing something clever and subversive. Maybe the visuals are western generic on purpose so that they can sneak in some of the book choice of words like jihad? 


Maybe, none of us seen the movie after all yet, but the trailer is all about that ""crusade"" safety. We just cant have people starting conversations.

6913,"Sanderson's heart is definitely in the right place, but like so many of us he still has a lot of work to do.

The main difference for Sanderson I think is that so far he has shown he is willing to listen and change. Even if he stumbles along the way and still isn't quite there yet, it is more than a lot of authors do. I know several authirs who if challenged will just insult the speaker and double down on their problematic bits.

It is my observation that Sanderson doesn't read between the lines of his own work. He doesn't consider the messages his work sends out there enough.

I have my own list of other problematic bits of his writing you can add to this that support this idea. Note: This is not meant as an attack, merely a contribution of observations.

1. Big spoiler: &gt;!He has had 3x Arranged Marriage plots that have ended in the arranged couple in True Love. 3x times he has done this plot. It is disturbing...
This is on top of the fact that no one in his books gets divorced ever. !&lt;
2. Kaladin's depression and in particular his suicide ideation doesn't play well with me. Why? Because when Kaladin did &gt;!consider suicide!&lt;, he wasn't talked out of it by another human being or a friend or even himself. He got talked out of it by a &gt;!spren. A whimsical shoulder angel.!&lt;

3. The Ending of Hero of Ages infuriates me. I am an agnostic-atheist so the religious beats don't resonate with me. 

When &gt;!Sazed takes up the Powers of 2x Shards, he remakes the world through the knowldge he had gathered over time. This is inherently a powerful moment.

For me it is underminedby the fact that Sazed's knowledge is only about religions. Specifically religions that aren't practiced any more that he sometimes casually recommmends to people despite only know what amounts to footnotes about how they work. 

When the narration describes the religions, they amount to ""the worship of x"" Sazed remakes the world's wildlife from a religion that worships animals. Put the planet back in its orbit from information from the religion that worshipped the stars 

The message this sends is that worship and religious texts are all the world needs.!&lt;

4. Sanderson loves his Genetic Magic Systems. Magic where you either have it or you don't and there is no way to get it otherwise. 

He explores inequality through this a bit and in Stormlight makes it seem like the Spren choose those who get Surge Binding, but there is no real way to seek specific Magic.

5. In the Rithmatist, you can only get the magic if &gt;!you go through a major relgious ritual for a specific religion. No other religion will work. Sanderson goes out of his way to say that not all those who go through the trial stay members of the religion or even are members of the religion. 

The fact remains that the magic system is bound to a specific religious practice of a specific faith.

The message it seems he seems to send with this is, ""Don't give up on religion until you've seen the whole thing. Without doing that, you can't reach enlightenment or Power ever"". !&lt;

That's my list off the top of my head.",Fantasy

6966,"Tom Lloyds series the Twilight Reign (five books) is a shoe-in for a list such as this. Both political scheming topped off with huge battles between humans, god-aspects and powerful artifacts. Truly a hidden gem. 

""Isak is a white-eye, feared and despised in equal measure. Trapped in a life of poverty, hated and abused by his father, Isak dreams of escape, but when his chance comes, it isn't to a place in the army as he'd expected. Instead, the Gods have marked him out as heir-elect to the brooding Lord Bahl, the Lord of the Fahlan.
Lord Bahl is also a white-eye, a genetic rarity that produces men stronger, more savage and more charismatic than their normal counterparts. Their magnetic charm and brute strength both inspires and oppresses others.
Now is the time for revenge, and the forging of empires. With mounting envy and malice the men who would themselves be kings watch Isak, chosen by Gods as flawed as the humans who serve them, as he is shaped and moulded to fulfil the prophecies that are encircling him like scavenger birds. The various factions jostle for the upper hand, and that means violence, but the Gods have been silent too long and that violence is about to spill over and paint the world the colour of spilled blood and guts and pain and anguish.""",Fantasy

The point of Toph's story has nothing to do with the specific profession (law enforcement) and everything to do with the fact that you can try to be the best at your profession *and* the best parent..  but sometimes, it doesn't work out. More importantly, you can realize that it didn't, in enough time to reconnect with what's really important to you.

She tried to be a good authority figure so her kids wouldn't have the problem with stupid authority that she had when she was a kid. It didn't work out, but she's still awesome for trying.

She *absolutely* became a cop. And *absolutely* showed the kids in the audience that sometimes, adults make mistakes, but if your family is willing to give them a second chance, they are worth taking that chance on.

Dune certainly has a particular art style which I enjoy, but the special effects at the time were a very mixed bag compared to other movies and even within the movie itself.

The overall story arc I love and there were some great performances, but some scenes and actors were just terrible and wooden. I cringed watching the knife duals and many of the main pitched battles - oh dear, so average.

7032,"While I think this is a very well thought out post and argument, I do think that the arguments against your concerns here are at least as good as yours. The difficulty is the heart of a good philosophical debate, which is part of what makes sandersons work really impressive! 

The Lord Ruler creating the skaa to be genetically inferior to the nobles in order to have a working class engages a really interesting question about labor supply and demand. TLR didn't do it just because he wanted some slaves to make the nobles lives easier. He did it because the demand for more farmers was really high in this broken new ashworld he'd created. If they didn't have a significant portion of the population farming, they wouldn't produce enough to survive. This doesn't mean by any stretch that what he did was GOOD, but the real debate is about what he could have done instead that would have saved the same or more lives. There's no easy answer to this, which negates the issue of Sanderson accidentally supporting enslaving an inferior race/species/whatever, imo.

One of my favorite scenes is where Sanderson pushes back against this idea you're concerned he unintentionally promotes: 

Sah slammed the hatchet down into the wood, sending a chip fluttering into the air. “And that’s why we should be free now? Because we’re acting like you? We deserved slavery before, when we were different? It’s all right to dominate us when we won’t fight back, but now it’s not, because we can _talk_?” 
“Well, I mean—” 
“That’s why I’m angry! Thank you for what you’re showing us, but don’t expect me to be happy that I need you for it. This just reinforces the belief within you, maybe even within myself, that your people should be the ones who decide upon our freedom in the first place.”",Fantasy

The reason I ask is because I don't see either as cult in our real-world sense of the word. Neither of these organizations has a primary focus on a religious ideal. They're instead secret organizations that specialise in intelligence gathering and assassination for whatever goal with some mystical trappings (which I attribute to both groups belonging to fantasy settings).

If you see these groups not as religious/mystical cults but as spy organizations of sorts, they make a lot more sense. If you want to join such an organization, a more extreme act is needed to convince the leaders you're dedicated to joining them. No cult would do this; they prefer the slow corruption you describe but if these are not cults, why would they rely on the same rules? These groups operate in secrecy and don't particularly care to spread their ideals. They'll recruit people but not as a believers primarily but as agents instead.",Fantasy

7047,"The plantations for one, and some of the 'dressings' of the relationship between noble and Skaa are very reminiscent of that time. 

As for your second question. Short answer, no, not really. One cannot create a work in a vacuum. Any author should take cultural context into account when releasing a book and I know for a fact that Sanderson is very aware of this. He's spoken at length about it.

However, as I mentioned in a reply above, the point of my post wasn't intended to drill down on the specific allegorical implications anyway. It was more of a general point about the portrayal of race and slavery that happened to be amplified by the fact that it was written by a white american.

Any difficult topic in fiction should be approached with care and justifying slavery with genetically engineering the race to be slaves would be a bad look regardless of who the author was. Again, I believe Sanderson's intent was to make a progressive commentary but this commentary got lost and then undermined later in the series.",Fantasy
7048,"I think everyone has a right to put forward an analysis, but that doesn’t mean they’ll all be equally valid. I think there are some things that can legitimately be left up to interpretation, while others just come from a flawed reading of the text and its context, which the author should indeed be able to set right.

For example, a lot of right-wing readers might tell you that the message of *1984* and *Animal Farm* is that socialism is bad and capitalism is good. Does that interpretation have equal value with Orwell saying they’re about capitalism, fascism, and Stalinism all being authoritarian ideologies and that his intent was to promote democratic socialism? Given that you can see the themes directly grow out of Orwell’s experiences fighting in the Spanish Civil War (for anarchist/democratic socialism and against fascism, capitalism, and Stalinism), the text of *1984* says that capitalism also contained the seeds of totalitarianism, and the ending of *Animal Farm* is “in the end, Stalinism was *just as bad as* what came before and not as good as the period after the revolution but before the authoritarian takeover” not “what came before was so much better,” then I’d say that the right-wing interpretation is just fundamentally less accurate and less valuable than Orwell’s own. But it is unfortunately very common.

I’d say there can be surface-level interpretations of a work and deeper interpretations. The latter don’t always have to come from the author themself, but often an author can provide context or state their intent in such a way that recontextualizes your reading and makes you get the deeper meaning. If someone reads *The Forever War* by Joe Haldeman with no other context and comes out thinking “oh, he wrote this because he wanted to warn us about the social implications of interstellar travel and war,” but then the author informs them that while yes, that was part of it and on the surface, it was primarily an allegory for the alienation felt by returning Vietnam War veterans, the proper response should be “oh, that makes so much sense, I now see this much deeper and richer meaning,” not “nuh-uh, my interpretation is just as valid as yours.”

There are certainly times when an author can’t let go of their work and keeps retconning things, or says they had an intent that even knowing it really isn’t visible in the text, or claims that a story really was not influenced by some part of their cultural context when someone outside that context can see the unconscious impact that it must have had. All of those are valid ways of analyzing a text counter to the author’s own analysis. But to totalize that as “the author’s interpretation is no more valid than the reader’s” at all times is a mistake, I think. The author doesn’t have a monopoly on truth, but more often than not, they will have a better handle on their intent and the themes of the work than the average reader. Obviously everyone is allowed to have an opinion, we don’t (yet) live in a mind control society. But sometimes the rest of us are allowed to say “that’s a really shallow interpretation, maybe you should listen to the author...”",Fantasy

7054,"You might be interested in [this breakdown of the portrayal of the Parshendi in The Stormlight Archive.](https://www.pornokitsch.com/2015/07/words-of-radiance-by-brandon-sanderson.html) It hits quite a few of the same uncomfortable notes you've covered in Mistborn. Quoted below is what I'd consider the core thesis of the breakdown, but the article itself goes into much more detail.

&gt;This is the core conflict of the book. Not whether or not the Parshendi are evil: that's a fact of the text. The challenge is whether or not the Alethi will recognise that fact in time. 

&gt;There are two additional layers to this already uncomfortable narrative. 

&gt;The first is, of course, that the Parshendi are dark-skinned, and described as athletic, primitive, superstitious and (literally) having a great sense of rhythm. In any context, this would be awkward. But in a book that's essentially about an apocalyptic race war, it disastrous. 

&gt;The second is the way this story is presented. Words of Radiance is not written from a multi-faceted point of view: a colonialist narrative that is then balanced by a second, equal narrative from any other perspective. Indeed, its colonial point of view is never questioned. It is presented as objective truth. Dalinar does talk to God, the Parshendi are minions of the great evil, a potential slave uprising is a bad thing, and the challenge here is a race against the clock to commit genocide.",Fantasy

7065,"&gt;  especially book 1 being a clear allegory for American slavery

Sanderson is American, but are there other things connecting it to American slavery? Would it be possible for an American author to write a book that has slavery as a theme, but is not related to the history of American slavery? I feel it is necessary to remind people that slavery is a global phenomenon that has existed everywhere, even though the dominance of American culture means that many people even outside the USA think of American slavery when they hear the word.

Certainly non-Americans could write about slavery without needing to consider the context of American slavery. Are Americans not allowed the same?",Fantasy

Enderal is not afraid of tragedy or of handling themes commercial games prefer to avoid like the plague. Enderal is the best argument for the statement that sad stories are the most beautiful.

And my second paragraph stands. It's clearly declared that slavery and racism is bad EVEN WITH the biological difference.

7130,"I grew up watching the 84 Dune and I loved it. It was so much darker and weirder than Star Wars, Flash Gordon and all of the other “space opera” sci-fi movies I loved in the 80s. The cast was outrageously good. Of course I prefer the much longer version than the messy two hour cut they used to show on TV. The cool networks would split the long version into 2 parts and show them across two nights in the summer. I’ll never forget Paul Atreides riding the Sandworm accompanied by a thunderstorm and a soundtrack by Toto, bringing down destruction on the Harkonnens. It was as Wagnerian as 80s sci-fi ever got. So damn cool.

It’s funny how stuff imprints on you from an early age. Years later when I read the book for the first time - masterpiece that it is - I couldn’t help but picture the Lynch aesthetics on every page, and couldn’t divorce the characters in my mind’s eye from the actors that portrayed them in the film. Sting in particular was very inspired casting.

The Villenueve film looks amazing and the man has made some of the best films this century with no duds on his resume. I’m on board 100 percent. That being said the trailers do strike me as more of a remake of the 84 Dune and less a totally new adaptation of the book. Which I would be fine with!",Fantasy

They work especially well in a light hearted book where they can be little jokes, but I also love dramatic or ironic titles. Oh, and when its ambiguous which character/thing the title refers to. Also single-word dramatic titles like “Justice.” 

...although... I also love how in old books, like mock epics and such, they’ll just spoil the whole chapter with a fuckin’ paragraph-long title like “IN WHICH Our Hero Discovers A Land Of Untold Riches, But Determines It Too Boring For His Liking, So He Has His Three Oxen Carry Cartloads Of Gemstones Back To His Hometown Wherein He May Sell Them For Two Hundred Pounds Each And Purchase Fine Cheeses,” it’s just always hilarious

It's a mistake that I see a lot, because people are usually quick to spread a famous quote that Tolkien wrote in the foreword to the second edition of LOTR; but they usually only quote the first sentence (the one not in italics), and forget about the rest, which completely changes the meaning:

*""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.* ***I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.****""*

&amp;#x200B;

Also all the following passages show his precise thoughts (about allegory as a whole or specifically about allegories in LOTR):

*""one finds, even in imperfect human 'literature', that the better and more consistent an allegory is the more easily can it be read 'just as a story'; and the better and more closely woven a story is the more easily can those so minded find allegory in it. But the two start out from opposite ends. You can make the Ring into an allegory of our own time, if you like: an allegory of the inevitable fate that waits for all attempts to defeat evil power by power. But that is only because all power magical or mechanical does always so work. You cannot write a story about an apparently simple magic ring without that bursting in, if you really take the ring seriously, and make things happen that would happen, if such a thing existed.""* **(Letter 109, 1947)**

*""I dislike Allegory – the conscious and intentional allegory – yet any attempt to explain the purport of myth or fairytale must use allegorical language. (And, of course, the more 'life' a story has the more readily will it be susceptible of allegorical interpretations: while the better a deliberate allegory is made the more nearly will it be acceptable just as a story.)""* **(Letter 131, 1951)**

\[About Tom Bombadil\] *""I do not mean him to be an allegory – or I should not have given him so particular, individual, and ridiculous a name – but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science:""* **(Letter 153, 1954)**

*""what appreciative readers have got out of the work or seen in it has seemed fair enough, even when I do not agree with it. Always excepting, of course, any 'interpretations' in the mode of simple allegory: that is, the particular and topical. In a larger sense, it is I suppose impossible to write any 'story' that is not allegorical in proportion as it 'comes to life'; since each of us is an allegory, embodying in a particular tale and clothed in the garments of time and place, universal truth and everlasting life. Anyway most people that have enjoyed The Lord of the Rings have been affected primarily by it as an exciting story; and that is how it was written. Though one does not, of course, escape from the question 'what is it about?' by that back door. That would be like answering an aesthetic question by talking of a point of technique. I suppose that if one makes a good choice in what is 'good narrative' (or 'good theatre') at a given point, it will also be found to be the case that the event described will be the most 'significant'.""* **(Letter 163, 1955)**

*""Thank you for your letter. I hope that you have enjoyed The Lord of the Rings? Enjoyed is the key-word. For it was written to amuse (in the highest sense): to be readable. There is no 'allegory', moral, political, or contemporary in the work at all.*

*It is a 'fairy-story', but one written – according to the belief I once expressed in an extended essay 'On Fairy-stories' that they are the proper audience – for adults. Because I think that fairy story has its own mode of reflecting 'truth', different from allegory, or (sustained) satire, or 'realism', and in some ways more powerful. But first of all it must succeed just as a tale, excite, please, and even on occasion move, and within its own imagined world be accorded (literary) belief. To succeed in that was my primary object.*

*But, of course, if one sets out to address 'adults' (mentally adult people anyway), they will not be pleased, excited, or moved unless the whole, or the incidents, seem to be about something worth considering, more e.g. than mere danger and escape: there must be some relevance to the 'human situation' (of all periods). So something of the teller's own reflections and 'values' will inevitably get worked in. This is not the same as allegory. We all, in groups or as individuals,* exemplify *general principles; but we do not* represent *them. The Hobbits are no more an 'allegory' than are (say) the pygmies of the African forest. Gollum is to me just a 'character' – an imagined person – who granted the situation acted so and so under opposing strains, as it appears to he probable that he would (there is always an incalculable element in any individual real or imagined: otherwise he/she would not be an individual but a 'type'.)* **(Letter 181, 1956)**

*""Of course my story is not an allegory of Atomic power, but of Power (exerted for Domination). Nuclear physics can be used for that purpose. But they need not be. They need not be used at all. If there is any contemporary reference in my story at all it is to what seems to me the most widespread assumption of our time: that if a thing can be done, it must be done.""* **(Letter 196, 1956)**

""*There is* no *'symbolism' or conscious allegory in my story. Allegory of the sort 'five wizards = five senses' is wholly foreign to my way of thinking. There were five wizards and that is just a unique part of history. To ask if the Orcs 'are' Communists is to me as sensible as asking if Communists are Orcs.*

*That there is no allegory does not, of course, say there is no applicability. There always is. And since I have not made the struggle wholly unequivocal: sloth and stupidity among hobbits, pride and \[illegible\] among Elves, grudge and greed in Dwarf-hearts, and folly and wickedness among the 'Kings of Men', and treachery and power-lust even among the 'Wizards', there is I suppose applicability in my story to present times. But I should say, if asked, the tale is not really about Power and Dominion: that only sets the wheels going; it is about Death and the desire for deathlessness. Which is hardly more than to say it is a tale written by a Man!""* **(Letter 203, 1957)**

*""I have no didactic purpose, and no allegorical intent. (I do not like allegory (properly so called: most readers appear to confuse it with significance or applicability) but that is a matter too long to deal with here.) But long narratives cannot be made out of nothing; and one cannot rearrange the primary matter in secondary patterns without indicating feelings and opinions about one's material.""* **(Letter 215, 1959)**",Fantasy

No, it's much worse than the X-Men.  X-Men generally acknowledged the core of the concern (people with wildly disproportionate threat profiles), but focused on the fact that they were people, who could choose to do good or evil just like anyone else.  Nemisin wrote orogenes such that every one of them is Alpha-level from toddlerhood, and an uncontrolled stray thought can murder entire towns, or kick off a Planet Wide Apocalypse.  It *really* undercuts the racism allegory she wants to tell, particularly because she doesn't even seem to notice the issue, and has her MC act like the fear and hatred of orogenes is just as petty and unjustified as skin color racism.",Fantasy

7171,"Loosely correlated? A subjugated race forced into slavery on plantations under the perceived excuse of being somehow lesser beings lines up pretty well to me. Even if it's not meant as a direct allegory for American slavery, the comparisons are still there and it's still written by a white American. You can't separate the circumstance in which the work was created and the content of the work.  But that said, my overall point was more holistic than that. Remove any connection to specific real world situations, take it down to the bare bones of slavery and racism and the problematic elements are still there.",Fantasy

He also really doesnt need the extra arm when he has storming magic powers. He’s still one of my favorite characters but this really feels like missed opportunity. If Lopen hadnt grown his arm back and Gaz hadnt grown his eye back, I think the healing system would be much more interesting.",Fantasy

Greed and ambition might be powerful factors shaping the background of the setting, but a huge percentage of the cast spends a huge portion of the on-page time trying to do what they think the right thing to do is, often despite the lack of reward.

A band of peasant insurgents, sick of being victimized by a brutal dynastic war, launch guerrilla raids against the forces of both sides to steal, to survive, and to get some payback. But when proof of a conspiracy prolonging the conflict falls into their hands, they must risk everything to convince the very enemies hunting them to expose the truth and bring the war to an end. About 97,000 words. 
  
**Publishers Weekly Starred Review:**  
&gt;*""Lewis’s excellent debut introduces a band of well-drawn outlaws who don’t care who wins the civil war that’s ravaging their land, just so long as it ends. Young healer Alessia abandons her monastic order when it bows to the bloodthirsty General Taurix, peasant Ulnoth is out for revenge after soldiers murder his family, and soldier Corren leaves his battalion to avoid killing innocents. Though their personalities initially clash, the deserters band together in a forest encampment, where they attract other refugees. But living peacefully proves impossible, and the three new leaders enact a cunning, deadly defense against the increasingly vicious armies. When they learn that the warring armies might themselves be pawns in a larger political game, it’s up to Alessia, Ulnoth, and Corren to stop the violence once and for all. The central trio are marvelously realized, and their developments amid the ongoing horrors are effortlessly convincing. Readers who love medieval-esque fantasy will delight in this rousing tale of rebellion.""*   
   
**Grimdark Magazine:**  
&gt; *""Dark, brutal and bloody, Lewis is not afraid to pack a punch...full of intelligent dialogue and intriguing plot points.""*

**Booklist:**

7201,"I'm not disabled in any respect, but I've done a bit of reading about the issue and know there's somewhat of a cure vs identity debate within the disabled community, so perhaps this is Sanderson trying to poke into the heads of both sides and see what points they're trying to bring to the table. 

Sanderson wrote a Reddit comment where he explained that Lopen grew his arm back because he considered his disability a personal drawback instead of something to fight through, especially since it wasn't something he was born with.

Now, that creates some cognitive dissonance with Renarin and Steris, especially when there's no neurodiversity movement or autism advocacy on Roshar. I think you can't draw direct parallels to the modern world, but I think part of it is that Renarin and Steris are 1) both fairly high-functioning and 2) upper-class. Writing the intersection of autism and poverty/depression/other factors is probably near impossible to do without experience, and potentially awfully bad optics if you get it wrong.

If you look at opposition to any disability identity movement, or support for a cure movement, it largely consists of members of and advocates for lower-functioning or poorer individuals, whose condition is more of a severe net detriment. Yeah, it might be iffy whether Lopen would fall into that category, but I think it's a nice effort from Sanderson to try to elucidate all sides of the debate.",Fantasy

I don't agree with the premise of your arguments, but as long as everyone is being civil this thread is fine as it is.",Fantasy

The acting is abysmal all round there's not one bright spark. 

It lacks all the atmosphere the British version created with beautiful  cinematography and a great soundtrack. 

I stopped at the point Jessica Hyde shot one of the crew who wasn't in the UK version and had some cheesy line about how there can only be one leader.

Grimdark works have never solely been about brutality and awfulness, the whole idea is oft defined by a pretty thick nihilistic undercurrent where because the world is shit and everyone's shit, you should just use whatever means you have to cling onto survival for dear life. Conveniently, it turns out this includes gratuitous physical violence and exercises of social/systemic power. It's not really a counter to escapism, its a justification for fantasizing about saying 'fuck the world I'm just here to survive' and then doing what you want because everyone else is too, supposedly.   


Flip the narrative to someone being beat down by those social structures, and suddenly that becomes less appealing and convincing and violates the expectations of grimdark.",Fantasy

I would say its Sazed who praises the Lord Ruler as a good person, so that's his perspective, not necessarily Sandersons.

You mentioned you'd be uncomfortable if he did what he did with Lopen with an autistic character and he kinda does in Elantris. There's a very autistic character who gets ""healed"" (that word feels wrong to use but I can't think of anything better, sorry) at the end and thats important for the ending scenes.",Fantasy

7234,"My understanding of magitek is that it's specifically involving technology that functions through the use of magic, not just any blend of sci-fi and fantasy tropes - that would be the broader category of science-fantasy.

I think *Perdido Street Station* features some magitek, if I recall correctly; the *Tensorate* series by Neon Yang also has it, and you could make the case that the *Machineries of Empire* series is powered on magitek. But I feel like ""magitek"" is also often used to refer to a specific industrial-feeling kind of setting or aesthetic, and in that regard Machineries might be too far from the mark.

If you're looking for any combination under the umbrella of science-fantasy, though, *Machineries of Empire* is a great example of science-fantasy, and grows more so as the series goes on. *Ashes of the Sun* is a quite recent book that also does this, with a variety of sci-fi and fantasy tropes mashed together (and a little bit of magitek, now that I think of it). The *Winnowing Flame* trilogy has some of this; it leans more fantasy, but there are aliens with exotic technology featured as well, so it doesn't feel like pure fantasy.",Fantasy

The other series books are longer - kind average novel length around 400-450 each.  I read those fairly recently and still have a pretty solid handle on how the second book ended, so I think for that one I’m going to just read the third book in the hopes I remember the salient details.

Further, you could also reach the conclusion that Sanderson declares that, *even if* biological differences exist slavery is still WRONG. Which I think is much more obvious conclusion. Even if the Skaa were a completely different species the slavery is wrong.",Fantasy

For me the stillsuit will always be that sexy black number even if it has no head covering, would roast you in the sun and provides no camouflage whatsoever in the desert. I think the weirding way being represented by the sonic weaponry was a creative way around not being able to portray the actual effect of prana-bindu convincingly at the time.

Even though Lynch ended up removing himself from the credits I think the 84 movie oozes its own charm and is a very rich representation (if not faithful) of the Dune universe. If it helps think of it a bit like Nosferatu; it's not Dracula but a worthy film in its own right.",Fantasy

The heroes by Joe Abercrombie is as much a discussion about war and hero worship as it is a book about a fictional battle. 
I think the OP offers an interesting perspective on the theme and influences surrounding the mistborn novels. Fantasy may be just fiction, but the thoughts and feelings writers pour into their work and readers extract from them are very real. I think it is ignorant to claim fantasy is where our cultures do not exist. The author, perhaps unintentionally, brings with them certain cultural biases when writing a book.

7261,"My husband and I wrote a gothic horror/fantasy and it's out today! We're so excited we barely mind that we're starting our launch day with no running water in the apartment. Halloween approaches, so you can fill some hard mode Bingo squares with a seasonally appropriate read.  

In the blackened heart of a cursed forest, a banshee haunts her crumbling castle with lethal screams.

Lady Vago is trapped in this place. She cannot fulfill her purpose as a banshee: to warn her loved ones of their deaths and watch over them while they pass. To solve the mystery of her imprisonment, she must sift through the rubble and ruin that surrounds her. By communing with old paintings, broken furniture, and even the stones themselves, she rediscovers who she was in life.

Before she was Lady Vago, she was Rovena Stoddard, a sharp-witted horse merchant's daughter that caught the eye of a charming baron. Lord Kalsten Vago's life as a wandering knight was over, but it inspired visions of a better life for his most vulnerable subjects. Rovena was far less afraid of bold change than his staunch and loyal steward, who saw her presence as a threat to Lord Kalsten's success. Love and shared dreams alone wouldn't overcome the controversy of the couple's hasty and unequal union, as well as the trials of governing a fledgling barony—Rovena knew that. What she failed to recognize was the deeper darkness taking root in Vago lands and hearts... 

Every memory of what Rovena loved is a reminder of what she lost, but she cannot let grief halt her search. Devoted spectres of ash are begging their lady for an end to their torment, and she will not let their agony–or her own–go unanswered anymore.

""Poignant, shocking and horrifying...Part love story and part gothic horror, the novel explores what happens when traditions are challenged, and the bloody consequences of a woman’s fight to build a fairer society. Despite its relatively short length, this is a rich story full of atmosphere and solid characterisation. Reminiscent of the works of such writers as Angela Carter, Frances Hardinge and Shirley Jackson, this is a rewarding novel..."" -- Jonathan Oliver, British Fantasy Award-winning editor and author of The Language of Beasts

7271,"I think you fully misunderstood what Tolkien said, because he actually agrees with you! You're just twisting the ""Death of the Author"" argument by putting words in his mouth to be able to kill him better.

What he *did* say is that he hated allegory **as opposed to applicability**. He didn't intend to write LOTR as a direct ww1 allegory, and it wasn't written to be understood as a specific allegory in general (whether you think of ww1, ww2, nuclear weapons, drugs or whatever you can imagine). BUT he relies on applicability instead, which is the power of the reader to make any symbolical link they want between the text and real world concepts/events/characters - while it stays clear that it's not the author's intent. (if anything, it would be more linked to wars as a general concept rather than just ww1 or ww2)

tl;dr: Tolkien doesn't merely say ""I did not intent to write a ww1 allegory and therefore it is everything but that, and anybody making the link is wrong""; he said ""you're free to see what you want in the book, but it wasn't my intent so you'd be wrong in taking this allegory as a fact if you want to analyse what LOTR meant to me as an author when I wrote it"".

Death of the author does allow you to interpret the story however you want (to which Tolkien kinda agrees with, as long as it stays your headcanon only), but you can't use it to say ""the author MEANT that and nothing else when he wrote it, no doubt permitted"" - that's just a straight-up lie!",Fantasy

7276,"The Lynch Dune film has some pretty serious flaws, but it's not all bad.  Its worst sin is that it was cut terribly in the theatrical releases, to the point of being quite incoherent.  The Lynch-isms tend to be love or hate, but I don't mind them.

What it does have going for it is some fabulous set and costume design, and Lynch's direction made it very atmospheric.  For all its faults, it really nails its own look and feel and the end result is nothing if not memorable.

But wait, there's more.  Several third-party re-edits have been done, most of which substantially improve on the theatrical releases.  Perhaps the best of these attempts is the Michael Warren version, which is freely available off the interwebs.  It's about 3 hours long and cuts in some storyboard art and potato quality video footage from scenes that were rehearsed but never shot, but end result is so, so much more coherent than the theatrical releases.

&amp;#x200B;

As for fantasy being a place divided from the real world, I think you might find most fantasy works are much more closely tied to real world cultures and history than it might seem at first glance. I don't know many living big name fantasy authors who don't use their works to examine sociological ideas and paradigms, if not writing outright allegory.

Maybe rules vary according to the country, but for example in UK noblewomen typically do not inherit estates. Of course they'd want to marry. Otherwise they might end up homeless when their father dies. It was a plot point in Pride And Prejudice.

Conversely, kings encountered a lot of problems when they wanted a divorce, because queens would not renounce their position easily. In order to remarry, Henry VIII had to create his own Church.

This is my favourite part of the book as well. I mean, as you point out, Herbert is cramming a LOT in here - lots of anthropological, religious, societal, and, uh, climatological philosophising. Maybe it is because I don't really get any of that - but I do understand fantasy - that the way he tinkered with the Chosen One trope really impressed me.

\&gt;I'm dying to see how he'll be able to bring the essence of the book to a visual medium.

Also agree! I know the upcoming adaptation has been discussed to death already on this sub, but I think Dune is clearly very, very, very hard to adapt - lots have tried, no one has gotten it 'right' (or even... 'right-ish').

7385,"I think you make a very good point about Mistborn.

I was quite uncomfortable with the way the Lord Ruler's actions were (rather clumsily imo) justified by Sazed, and the narrators general agreement with Sazed. There's a lot of other messed up stuff Sazed says throughout the series as well, which the books tend to take as being automatically wise without the need for justification. I think to a certain degree, Sazed could be a voice for some of Sanderson's religious upbringing that he may be struggling with personally. 

But I had forgotten too much of the allegory in the first you brought up to connect them as clearly an elegant as you did here. It's a really good piece of interpretive work you've done, and it's brought me a new perspective that lends a bit of credence to the discomfort I already felt.

Some are disagreeing but I think your general thesis is entirely accurate - that if you use allegory to point to real-world issues, then any betrayal of the thesis of that allegory implies a betrayal of how the thesis applies to those real-world issues. You can't justify the racism in Luthadel which was an allegory to racism in America without implying (accidentally or not) that a justification of the racism in America is possible.",Fantasy

Its to the point that the other Dune show from syfi I couldnt even watch past the first episode because visually it was just too silly.

I'd love if Lynch had done a multi hour mini series for each book. 

Heads up this part may contain spoilers:
The whole argument that Lynch doesnt portray the underlying message that no leader no matter how charismatic should be trusted was left out, I find is kinda lame. From what I remember of the first book it didnt get all crazy into that either as it was the set up for the rest of the series. Plus, how could anyone see how crazy self righteous Paul and company get at the end or how creepily exaltant his little sister was with herself after whacking the baron and not feel a tad uneasy about the whole Fremen jihad thing.

What if in war, nobody stayed dead? What if all those who died in a particular battle, were able to get back up, dust themselves off, and carry on as if nothing had happened? For the people of the Horack and Nairabian nations, this wasn’t just some thought experiment. For them, this was a reality. The Horack and Nairabian armies had been fighting the same war for nearly two hundred years; with neither side making much headway. This was because both nations had the equal ability to bring back all causalities they sustained in battle. Therefore, the question was: How do you win a war where no one ever stays dead? By this notion, you would, in turn, have a war that would never die either. A war that was… Immortal.

7393,I adore chapter titles. It always amazes me when authors shun the opportunity for artistic expression they afford. What would LOTR be without the iconic chapter titles.

7395,"&gt;It seems to me that if ASOIAF, where the good guys get killed, where the plot is reliably bleak, and where the central theme is Being A Good Person Won’t Save You,  isn’t grimdark, then grimdark is a sort of spoiler tag where a reader will know for certain that no part of the plot is allowed to end in resolution.

ASOIAF has hope. There are still actually good characters, with good motivations, who fight for something they believe in, and there's a very realistic chance of good guys winning. There's hope, because there's nothing inherently horrific about the world - just before the books started things were pretty okay, in general. Rough, sure, but not horrific. And there's a lot of hope that it could end in a somewhat optimistic way.

It's a dark series for sure. And sometimes it's very grim.

But a grimdark book, imo, has no hope.  It's about characters living in a world without hope, but going on anyway. Things won't get better in the grand scheme of things. Sure, they can win a bit here and there, survive to face the future, but you're not gonna get a happily ever after for the world. 

It's not really more of a spoiler than something being marketed as a romance novel - you know they're gonna get together, because it's a romance. If something's marketed as grimdark, you know it's not a feel-good novels and you won't expect an ending that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy and hopeful on the inside.

For three-way religious wars, I'd recommend The Lions of Al-Rassan by Guy Gavriel Kay.",Fantasy

Yeah, racist perceive other people as inferior despite them being the same as every other human, which makes the racist despicable.

As for Lopen, I disagree more. the Stormlight Archives are full of characters who are hero's despite various mental disabilities. In Lopens case, it isn't that he can't be a hero. it is that he can't fight as well with one arm. that's just the simple truth of the matter, in my opinion. you could try as hard as you want to justify him being a badass one armed fighter, but at the end of the day you can't really make him more skilled than those who have had signifcamtlyyyyyyyy longer to train and aren't faced with his physical disability.",Fantasy

7421,"I think Kate Elliot’s Crossroads reads like slice-of-life for the main part, and It definitely has dark undertones,  and trigger content both implicitly and explicitly.

It is a slow-build story over three books, which has themes related to war, religion, slavery and immigration to varying degrees.   The story is told from different POVs but everyone is involved in their own day to day shit, and the stakes, even when they are high, are mostly personal 

I have only read the first two books, there’s a potential scale large conflict looming and tension is building   It could become more epic, but the story is very character driven.

As I’m relatively new to fantasy, I had my doubts whether the series counts as slice of life so I looked up the r/Fantasy ‘s Bingo Card description (below) and I think it qualifies.

“Slice of Life / Small Scale Fantasy –  the term ""slice of life"" refers to a storytelling technique that presents a seemingly arbitrary sample of a character's life, which often lacks a coherent plot, conflict, or ending. The story may have little plot progress and often has no exposition, conflict, or dénouement.”

7427,"I think I read the first trilogy when I was around 13 and I liked the books well enough, but thought they were a tad depressing. I wanted a story about adventure, and overcoming challenges and a badass protagonist. This series is definitely not that.

  Then I ended up rereading the books in my early twenties and I appreciated them much more. Actually, it was interesting how differently I perceived certain moments and characters. 

  I definitely wouldn't classify the books as YA. The story is told as a sort of autobiography, the protagonist recounting his childhood. And you have a very realistic depiction of how a child and later a teenager would behave, with all of the mistakes and dumb choices one would make and the failure to grasp certain consequences or reasoning. 

  Then there's the part that you as a reader can see, but that is never acknowledged by the protagonist (even his 30 year old self), as he himself still doesn't understand it - all the child abuse he was put through, all of his own mental problems stemming from said childhood and so on...

7432,"Depends how they're used.

Chapter titles that are just PoV name and Location can be really helpful in multi-PoV books.

And some authors manage expectations really well -- the title can ""spoil"" part of what's going to happen in a way that leads reader expectations astray in a fun way.

A sort of cheap trick is using them to point to the ""zinger"" line of the chapter -- so that the reader will recognize when the author's favorite line shows up because it echoes the title. But even that can be effective, when used well.

Chapter headings can get very spoilerific in the old-style (see: Dickens) version where you get things like:

It starts with the POV of a billie teenager who can control insects.  While seeking to prove herself as a hero she 'infiltrates' a gang of villains.  It's a fantastic read, one of the best climaxes I have read in a  story.  Its not a short story either so loots of meat to get through.

7468,"Kingdom Come Deliverance puts you through a  lot of interesting side quests. Side quest spoilers ahead! 

There's one where the village priest, Father Godwin,tells you that three women in the village have come under suspicion of witchcraft and he needs you to follow them and see if there's any truth to the rumors and try to keep them safe. After following them for some time and learning of their intentions &gt;!(they want to drive the Cumans, who killed some of their loved ones) !&lt;They foolishly try to perform a ritual using a hallucinogenic plant and when you intervene you get accidentally dosed and start having insane hallucinations as well. Then a group of angry woodcutters attacks the women for witchcraft. You have to choose whether to kill the woodcutters to save the three women or let the women be killed before you pass out. 

It's an extremely interesting quest, though I think it has some very problematic elements to it which are played for laughs which unfortunately ruined it for me. Still, it is a unique quest that explored medieval fears around witches and witchcraft but also demonstrated that the three alleged ""witches"" in action were not acting out of evil or malice but rather out of immense grief and fear of the invading rebels in their homeland.",Fantasy
7469,"&gt; Even if the Lord Ruler was portrayed as evil throughout (which he isn’t,  and that makes it so much worse) by writing an allegory for slavery and  then retconning the idea that there was a biological disparity all  along, the work essentially implies there could be a biological  disparity between the real world counterparts of the allegory. Yeah,  super not great. Actually, tremendously fucked up the more you think  about it. 

That part seems very far fetched to me. I agree that it isn't helpful for the theme in the first book, but that conclusion is not valid.

&gt;!Now being 100% honest. When I started reading it I rolled my eyes and thought instantly. Here is a classic story where this self absorbed naive girl will fall in love with the ugly man she hates at first, and become some sort of hero/power women. Which is what happened right?!&lt;

What you’re saying is that a book is only grimdark if it is marketed as grimdark? Or only grimdark if an author says it’s grimdark? The term loses a lot of its usefulness if that’s the case.  

It seems to me that if ASOIAF, &gt;!where the good guys get killed!&lt; , where the plot is reliably bleak, and where the central theme is Being A Good Person Won’t Save You,  isn’t grimdark, then grimdark is a sort of spoiler tag where a reader will know for certain that no part of the plot is allowed to end in resolution.

Seems to me like this would remove a degree of tension and excitement from reading these kinds of books. 

I think one can reasonably shelve The Broken Earth trilogy with other grimdark titles as it shares many of that subgenre’s hallmarks in terms of plot, theme, characters, and setting.

And if everyone who ever had their own interpretation of a work sat down and wrote their own books, the world would have too many books and not enough people working in other industries. Your take here is basically maximum intellectual elitism, preserving the privilege of interpretation for only a handful of people and denying everyone else who are more than smart enough to interpret works for themselves the right to do so. Some people aren’t too uncreative to make their own works, they’re too poor, or too busy, or too uneducated (as in illiterate, but illiterate people can still make up stories).

7563,"I think there’s something here about the desire for a reader stand-in protagonist in fantasy. They have to be free from any context or attachments so they can go and have consequence-free adventures and so they’re new to any given situation or location, allowing the author to explain things to a fresh pair of eyes. Any particulars beyond broad personality traits could hinder that self-insert aspect, even if it’s worthwhile and interesting familial or relationship contexts.

I think this dovetails with the young protagonist thing in school or school-like narratives. Everything’s new, all the relationships are being formed before the protagonist’s eyes, the stage is set for the protagonist to do stuff and become the centre of attention.

Also the ending they were given by Martin RE Kings Landing could make sense in the books given &gt;!fAegon existing and being backed by Varys!&lt;. I do agree that Martin is struggling because he needs to start wrapping up plot points and as a gardener author, he is struggling to work out how that needs to happen.

Sanderson on the flip side clearly understood what made WoT work and even if some people didn't like the execution, it still fundamentally felt like WoT.

We can judge how well the author accomplished what they wanted to say with those words, but we can also consider what those words themselves actually said independently of authorial intent.

They were (sort of) grimdark before people knew what grimdark was.

Nowadays, however, a book is grimdark only if it is specifically written and marketed as grimdark. Nobody is ""accidentally grimdark"" anymore.

Then again, it takes more than a bleak setting to be grimdark. Some considers grimdark a ""fantasy protestantism"": characters have to choose between good and evil, and are ""just as lost as we are"". Grimdark is about moral choices and their consequences. If your daughter gets kidnapped and you go save her, it's not grimdark. Grimdark is when your daughter gets kidnapped but you hate her, so you consider not saving her, but then decide to go save her anyway, and it turns out your daughter pretended to be in danger to lure you out in a trap and kill you.",Fantasy

I'd definitely do the series your most exited by first but be ready to take a break once in a while to read something different. If you are most exited by WoT breaking it up with something completely different like  Harry Potter would work because the environment and characters are so different.

Then RJ wrote book 11, which was much better than the ones before, but Bradon wrote books 12 through 14. I loved every one of Brandon's books, they never made me feel joyless like the middle books that Jordan wrote, and characters that Jordan made me grow to hate, I'd begin to tolerate them much more, with the way that Brandon wrote their POV's and showed their thoughts. The repetition was much lesser, and I felt like what I was reading was actually important, so I didn't find myself wanting to skim the pages like I did with Jordan's books.

And to think that Jordan insisted that he could make only one book, considering that Brandon had to make 3 to finish all the plotlines, and there were still rushed plotlines that were left to be quickly solved in the last book, makes me doubt more Jordan's words that he could do it, specially seeing how some of his books had so little plot in many pages, and now he wanted to finish everything in only one book.",Fantasy

I don't even understand why they still produce remakes, when streaming makes TV shows and movies from all over the world easily accessible. Discovering the actual pop culture of other countries is a great way to expand your horizon and be more open to others. 

Perhaps Americans need to develop their dubbing industry, like a lot of countries did, as subtitles don't seem to suffice, though ? But that's hardly a problem with a British TV show like *Utopia*.

7665,"In terms of darkness i would put it into the same categorie ASoIaF is. If you call this grimdark or not is a matter of definition. ASoIaF is cathegorized as grimdark because it was at the beginning of the developement to a darker style of fantasy. Fifth Season and ASoIaF both have hope, they both show the character groth is possible and they both have protagonists that a dark and selfish at times too.
They do differ in many ways from Abercrombies work (especially the ability of characters to chage) and are a worlds apart from Scott R. Baker in terms of hopelessness.

The main thing the Fifth Season is praised for is the way it incorporates real world themes in its story. So the darkness is not the first thing people see when they look at the fith season.
The one thing which is interesting for me is how much the readers are willing to overlook Essuns own cruelty and how much it seams to bother her when she kills innocent people. So as a protagonist Essun is not completly on the bright side for me.
But in terms of genre it is often more important why a book is praised at the first glance. Martins big difference compared with other fantasy of his time was the darkness and moral greyness of his characters. Jemisen was praised for other things so people don`t put her in the grimdark categorie. I would argue that ASoIaF would not seen as grimdark if it would be released today because we have seen much grimmer things in the last years.",Fantasy

I fucking love them but I have to take breaks but damn, shits dark. It’s actually kind of a sci-fi and not fantasy, but not hard sci-fi. 

A lot of people find some of the characters unlikeable and aggressive but that feels like sexism to me. (Ethan is a tough strong man but Essen just a bitch, if you know what I mean). People don’t want to read about racism and slavery other than in a quick feel good way, Kelsier from Mistborn kind of way. (I like Sanderson a lot but it was not an emotional look at slavery but a outside savior-heist narrative.) I definitely think that the combination of female writers and female protagonists plays a role in this. There’s a element of deep perspective shift and I feel like some men might not relate.

Also reddit is kind of a self-perpetuating hive mind.  Reddit skews a bit young so the Essen/Nasun relationship might not hit for younger people.

7703,"The second book is even better than the first one, go read it quick!

Sanderson doesn't write in his own style, but he doesn't try to write in Jordan's style either. It would be hard to define Jordan's style as it changes over the course of the 11 books he write. IMO the first 3 were very well edited with tight pacing, no unnecessary parts. But my guess is as he got more popular, he gained more power and his editor stopped correcting him as much. By the time you get to the 6th book you can see the pacing is starting to ramble and after that there's no end in sight and no direction for the next 5 books.

I just had a realization. In Sanderson's lectures on writing, he talks about progress, which he considers to be one of the elements required for a good plot. By progress he means that the protagonist has to be working towards a goal, and over time, there is a clear and measurable sense of progress towards that goal. He says it took him a long time to learn of the importance of progress, but he did not say where he learnt it from.

I just realized that maybe he learned about it from reading WoT? The first 3 books has good pacing and a clear sense of progress. After that it's a bit shaky but still not so bad. We know the final end point, the Dark One gets defeated at the Last Battle. But how close are we to the Last Battle, and how long is it going to take us to get there? For a while there was a clear sense of progress from counting the number of Forsaken that had been defeated. But then after a while you get some books where no Forsaken get defeated at all, and there is no sense of progress to the end point.

There's a similar flaw in the recent A Song of Ice and Fire books too. That's probably why it was so hard to write a satisfying ending for Season 8 of GoT (Because it was nowhere near the ending point and should have gone on for several more seasons to tie everything up)

Anyways tl;dr: My personal opinion is you should read the first 3 books of WoT, pretend it's a trilogy, stop there, and go read something else. 

WoT is a series that is important to me, as it was the first series that made me realized I loved reading. If I could go back in time, this is the advice I would like to give to my younger self.",Fantasy

-EDIT FOR RANT- And what really ticks me off about the Jack Bauer argument is that it *completely* missed the point of those scenes and that character's decisions. 

Jack Bauer tortures a terrorist to gain information that saves millions of lives. He does this *knowing* that it is illegal, unsanctioned action which may result in his own arrest and conviction, but he does it anyway because it *must* be done. He's willing to accept the consequences of his actions. This is what makes him a hero.

Warhammer 40k is grimdark. 40k has none of the good people that ASoIaF has. The God Emperor is failing, and even the troops he provides are pretty fucked up. It's not just ""is man not tempted to evil when the stakes are high enough?"", but ""is not the only way man can make a stand against evil by being even more fucked-up than evil is?"" That's the ol Grimdark. When the good guys aren't morally questionable, but straight up bad guys, just leagues less bad than the actual bad guys. You can find redeemable qualities in the ""good"" ASoIaF factions, and reasons that their scions might be flawed, but ultimately mean well and are trying to do a recognizable good in a *flawed*, but not completely irredeemable, world. *Everything leads to bad ends* in Grimdark, because the world is a grim and a dark place.

For that reason, writing about how unhealthy clinging to ideas like forced romances immediately grabs my attention.

Whether it's the narrative voice stopping to deliver the moral *du jour,* or the characters giving grandstanding speeches, or debates written one-sidedly, it annoys me. The few times I tolerate it tend to be when it's the narrative voice adding it in a la Severian from the Book of the New Sun or Hadrian Marlowe from the Sun Eater books, where it's baked into the first person narrative. 

It's especially bad when it's multiple characters parroting the same thing (Malazan has been annoying me with this. I don't object to soldiers philosophizing; I object to fifteen different soldiers all sounding like the exact same philosopher).

I will admit part of the problem is I'm reading existing web serials, and so it means I have to catch up. They do get much more bearable if you read them on a release by release basis instead of catching up with years of released chapters. Their plot to length density is low, but that isn't as big a deal if you read on a chapter per week basis (or whatever the release schedule is).",Fantasy

Like, I can take a lot of grimdark and find something to find interesting, but I cannot stand how pervasive the class system seems to be in a lot of fantasy. It's like a crazy blindspot that makes me want to slap the author and the fans. There's criticism in these stories, but it's unlikely any of these series end with ""All your favorite characters die because the nobility are parasites.""

Also, magical lineages: subvert them more. Make it a propaganda thing. Something other than leaning full-ass in.

It's akin to the folks on Facebook who post little ""poetry"" graphics about how broken they are and how internally scarred they are because they think it's deep. It's not deep, it's pitying. Likewise, misery is not realistic when it is only misery. The person convinced everyone is out to screw them over is just as naive as the person convinced everyone has their best interest at heart.

Edit: Found the quote! It's from (according to my Google-fu) Richard Curtis.


&gt;""If you write a story about a soldier going AWOL and kidnapping a pregnant woman and finally shooting her in the head, it’s called searingly realistic, even though it’s never happened in the history of mankind.

Meanwhile, AQotWF puts empathy in the *reader* by not shying away from how bad things can be and teasing out the desire to make hope in the real world where it can’t be found in the story.

7940,"Because it's not fantasy in the traditional sense. It's better classified as a dystopian sci-fantasy novel. Also, I personally think this book is WAY overrated. The ""magic system"" is more of just a mutation along the lines of X-Men except everyone is the mutant Avalanche (or Kwame from Captain Planet). The apocalyptic broken earth setting is not revolutionary either - just another dying planet setting (e.g. Dark Sun). The plot is fragmented and not particularly compelling. The ""big reveals"" are not at all mind-blowing and can be deduced quite easily from just a few chapters in. The themes of racism and revenge are pedestrian. The explicit violence and sexual content seems forced. And the 2nd person point of view is absolutely horrendous to read. I almost dropped this book halfway through, even though I've finished every book I've ever started. Why this series won the Hugo Award 3 years running still confounds me!",Fantasy

It's not that she doesn't do brutal things sometimes - she does- but it's more because of her humanity than some innate desire to be hopeless or cynical. 

It is a brutal book - &gt;!the death of her son in particular was very difficult for me.!&lt; However, sad/brutal things don't make something grimdark. Otherwise Oathbringer could be considered grimdark for Dalinar's past, and that's obviously a joke because it's definitely not haha.",Fantasy

8012,"Unsustainable levels of violence trying to be real or edgy. There’s a personal level: even fit young people get career-ending injuries pretty easily, trauma lingers, disabilities happen, etc. I’ve read too many novels where someone bounces back from a severe injury like action movie hero are missing the mark on realism and it gets as boring as anything else where the plot works only by authorial fiat. If the series has magic, that can change things but you need to show it working - do common people have access? Does it work instantly? Do you still wrestle with PTSD? Does our army have dozens of healers exhausting themselves keeping the hero of legend soloing the other army?

There’s a larger level, too, for organizations or cultures. Most fantasy is set in agrarian contexts where food production is labor intensive and unreliable. If you’re writing about a massive modern-scale city, there should be some reference to the never ending stream of barges or carts bringing food in from the huge ring of farms around the city, magical stasis keeping stockpiles from spoiling, the only trees around are in rich people’s gardens and firewood is expensive, etc. If you’re fielding armies with thousands of people, show an organized economy which can support that many people not working. If they commonly get wiped out at high rates, show the political fallout and troubles recruiting soldiers, economic fallout from so many missing workers, etc.  A frontier of hearty settlers hanging on in an unforgiving environment is fun to write but the battles are likely to involve dozens to hundreds of people, not tens of thousands. 

Magic again can change this but it has to fit the world-building - e.g. if mages can wipe out thousands of people effortlessly, explain why the regular soldiers don’t flee as soon as they see one. Legions of imperial healers patching up soldiers avoids one set of problems but you need a high magic setting for the scale go work.",Fantasy

You never hear the following criticised because of realism:
1) The completely fucked up gender ratio in most fantasy novels, where women appear to make up 20% of the population, at most. 

2) The bizzaro way religion is handled which generally has no historical analogue whatsoever. 

3) The mismash of technologies that gives you massive castles and no firearms to speak of. 

4) The reality of serfdom and the fact that most people were very close to starving most of the time and bad weather and illness were by far the biggest existential threats facing anyone. 

5) Cod-royalty which absolutely does not reflect how most aristocracy lived in medieval times, which was way less glamorous and private than commonly supposed.

I never found his shenanigans charming.  With Sanderson, I actually thought he was what Jordan had been telling me he was all these years.  I loved Sanderson's Mat.

8050,"Is it in every single book? No, of course not. But in my experience (and judging on previous posts about this subject) it's certainly not rare. If you broaden it to sexual violence, it's in even more books. If you broaden that to dubious consent, it gets difficult to name a book without it (and trust me, it's become so normal that some of these moments don't even register. I've have some instances pointed out to me, that I completely missed at first). Rape off screen is still rape. I haven't read a massive amount of fantasy books yet and I've come across plenty of pretty disturbing scenes with sexual violence. There's also a ton of sexism in Fantasy books that annoys me just as much. [This article](https://www.tor.com/2016/08/22/do-better-sexual-violence-in-sff/) is a decent opinion piece describing the sexual violence in SFF books phenomenon. If you Google rape in Fantasy, you'll get a lot of websites/forums discussing it, in case you want to read more.

Edit: Before someone falls over the not a massive amount of fantasy books, I'm roughly around the 65-80 fantasy books in total, which I don't think is that much, considering. But hey, you could also just explain why you think I'm wrong instead of just downvoting an honest contribution.

For whatever reason, fantasy has *really* bought into the multiple POVs as a storytelling device. And not just multiple POVs of the same events but multiple storylines that (you hope) eventually come together. So, in a sense, you're reading three books that are only quasi-related. No wonder if takes a few hundred pages for any of the three or four storylines to go anywhere.

This really struck me while reading *The Heresy Within* by Rob Hayes which has three unrelated groups of people who take a good 50% of the book to finally meet up and ""form the party"".

I mean, first I have a problem with the idea of 'realism' as a mode of fiction in the first place, but the premium a lot fantasy fans have placed on it (repeat--*fantasy fans*), and its merging with cartoonish grittiness and outright nihilism sucks a lot of joy from stories for me.

I can’t think of an example where reading that had actually moved the plot along in a way that I enjoyed. It’s just not for me. 

As for why I am sick of them it just feel like at the moment it’s a big part of the fantasy genre. I have read so many blurbs recently that describe a gritty, brutal character doing gritty brutal things in a “horrors-of-war” type book. The reason I read fantasy is for escapism and wonder, not to be confronted with the spectre of despair that comes with war.

* Sanderson-Mediocre prose with terrible character writing
* Mercy Thompson series-The fact that *multiple* people recommended me this after liking Kate Daniels is mind boggling. Aside from being UF, they don't have a single thing in common.

They were big in the late '80s and early '90s after the first two Dragonlance triologies (*Chronicles* and *Legends*) had come out and TSR was getting down to the business of milking the series with tons of spin-offs while increasingly putting out fiction.

*The Icewind Dale Trilogy* did well and picked up steam as it went on with Drizzt becoming a breakout character. So a prequel series was released, *The Dark Elf Trilogy* that focused on him. By the time that the Drizzt-focused sequel to *Icewind Dale* came out, *Legacy* was when the series really peaked. It was a *huge* success. To almost the same degree as Dragonlance and was TSR's first hardcover. It sold *really* well and became pretty omnipresent for a while. The sequel, *Starless Night*, also did well and was seen often enough that the original cover alone instantly brings up a lot of nostalgia even though I never read it.

From there it started to drop off. Checking Wikipedia it looks like they still sold well, but they had kind of dropped out of the popular consciousness.

It will look like a dialogue, but in truth we are both so sophisticated and confident of our perspective that, for each other, we are hardly more than apologetics pornography, used to mentally masturbate our intellect. No intent to listen or compromise was ever present.

I rewatch favourite tv shows all the time. I like the comfort of something familiar. 

I’m extremely tired of books that are presented as grim dark or with moral Grey characters. I don’t need to read 10 books in a row where every character is being shit to every other character.  I’m more of a plot/story dude than a character dude anyway so this is personal preference. 

And I’m really sick of elves, dwarves, orcs etc. There’s so little variance in fantasy races and it makes me sad. 

But the thing I am most sick of is reading a book that clearly is written for a male audience. I’m a guy but I’m finding myself constantly frustrated by our need to write characters that are supposedly the ideal model of masculinity. It’s always outdated and gross.

8197,"Abercrombie has indeed become a better writer. I liked the First Law trilogy, but found it messy, scattered and weirdly paced. I sort of liked Best Served Cold, but again, it felt scattered, and at times repetitive. Too long.

Recently read Red Country and wow, what an improvement. I'm about 2/3rds done with the first book in the Age of Madness trilogy and am enjoying it immensely. So much tighter, focussed and compelling. I still find he uses too many characters and some of the characters feel like re-skins of characters from his other books. But Abercrombie is really impressing me more and more.

I gave up on the fantasy genre for a while. Got bored. But Abercrombie is the exception for me. His stuff is great writing—that just so happens to exist in a fantasy setting. Darkly comedic and well-told tales.",Fantasy

8209,"I really liked them personally, but have since moved on to more mature material.

That's what I would say about these books, fun but immature. Did you ever see the Chronicles of Riddick? Not thay last travesty, but the first two. Lots of fun, mostly action, few dorky lines, light on plot. That's how these books will read.

So just prepare yourself for that type of book and you'll have a fun time. Fair warning, if you play dnd you've 100% run into someone pretending to be Drizzt before. Also, he's a bit of a Gary Stu imho. 

That being said, it's not entirely without self examining qualities. Everyone is racist to Drizzt because dark elves are evil, so that plays out in interesting ways. A lot of the characters have tortured pasts that get looked at to a greater or lesser extent. Character development is at about a 6/10 so not terrible.

I'd say go for it.",Fantasy

8230,Half a King by Joe Abercrombie,Fantasy
8231,"Here are a few of my current favourites: 

**An Elegy of Heroes: The Agartes Epilogues by K. S. Villoso** is an epic fantasy that doesn't focus on the heroes of the super powerful magicians or the royalty. Instead it focuses on normal people who get caught up in everything. It's an excellent epic fantasy with rich world-building and great characterizations. There's a mystery relating to some ancient powers and monsters and it spans many different kingdoms and empires, showing us a vast and very realistic world that I fell in love with. Chronologically this trilogy takes place before Villoso's more famous ongoing trilogy starting with **The Wolf of Oren-Yaro**. 

**The Chronicles of Adalmearc by D. E. Olesen** is an epic fantasy set in a realm that has just lost its High King. This leaves a bit of a power vacuum that causes all kinds of battles and power grabs and political battles between the nobles of the land. It's very descriptive (almost reminiscent of Tolkien) and this makes for some excellent sieges and battles because I was able to imagine what was going on and follow the strategies of the battles. And at the heart of the series there are some really strong characterizations of varying characters who are trying to do what they think is best for the realm, but often each character's definition of that is different. 

**Currently by Sarah Mensinga** is a steampunk stand-alone novel. It's got some of the best world-building I've come across in this subgenre and the main character's adventure allows us to see a variety of different cities across this world that is ruled by tides. There's also an interesting magic system and some excellent characterizations. 

And if you like the steampunk genre I would also recommend **Askaro of the Falcon by Lady Li Andre**, which has more of a focus on an airship and on one city and is very fast-paced. 

I'm currently reading **Between the Shade and the Shadow by Coleman Alexander** and loving it. It's got a non-human protagonist (a sprite-ling that dwells in the forest) who has some cool powers and lives in a very unique society.",Fantasy

8277,"To tell the truth, pretty much all of Wildbow's stories fit this request to some degree. Except maybe Pale, but then again that's only partway through, so give it time.

**[Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/)**: the estranged black sheep of a family unexpectedly becomes his grandmother's sole heir, discovers that magic is real, that his family was into some dark, dark stuff, and that he has inherited a great many enemies along with her estate.

The whole story is something of an exercise in how much someone can lose and still remain a person. Literally so, in some cases. Just about every encounter takes something from the protagonist, win or loss, and the wins tend to be pyrrhic in the best cases.

The biggest complaint against this story is that it's unrelenting and brutal in its pacing, but frankly that sounds like what you're looking for, so here I guess it's a plus.

**[Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)**: a bullied teenager gets super powers and sets out to become a hero, only to become an accidental villain due to circumstances and her own distrust of authority. By and large, her experience with superpowers is one of escalation and conflict, with her wins often coming in the form of short term gains that invite more trouble down the road.

Almost certainly my favorite take on superheroes, with a great explanation for powers that ties everything together pretty much perfectly. Good characters, good worldbuilding, all around great story.",Fantasy

8281,"Women:

Women, especially queens did way more than just pop out kids. Many of them ruled over their husband's households while they went off to war. Many Queens also ruled the kingdom when the husband was away. Some were also regents for their sons and some Kings put their sisters in charge of lands. In general, women did get a dowery and money for their own usage. It was not like they were without rights and privileges. Noblewomen were not just fuck toys for men to be abused and raped. If a husband raped his wife then he would have to take it up with his wife's family. Even in medieval times many kings and lords did in fact care about their daughter's wellbeing. Medieval Europe was not like Somalia. Women, especially noblewomen were highly-regarded and to abuse, such a woman would be seen as distasteful and a very bad political move.

Religion: No one in Medival Europe would ever go around saying he does not like god. That would be fucking dangerous and stupid. I doubt there were any atheists to be found during these times. Religion was in fact the most important thing for a medieval person, especially a peasant.

Marriage: Women could object to a marriage. Consent was necessary, though obviously, most women would never do that given the consequences. Consummation usually happened much later in the marriage and certainly not at age 12 or 11. 

Monasteries: bein a monk or a nun was not as bad as some people think. Especially not for women. Better to be a nun than to be torn apart by your 12th pregnancy. 

Armor: cannot be penetrated easily by arrows. Most knights died through stabbing weapons.

War: most medieval warfare was not super epic and most men died from sickness and hunger than in actual fighting.

Peasants were really uneducated. Like they could not read. Many nobles couldn't even read depending on the timeline. I read so many fantasy books where the main peasant guy can read and write and has the same education as a noble.",Fantasy

8283,"It is, but it's not nearly as bad as was described. The torture of Valyn's LI isn't shown, her murder is a mystery for much of book one, the people tortured for the Leeches powers are mostly unremarkable and not super detailed, and the BDSM stuff isn't nearly as prevalent or graphic either.

The worse bit is when the female members of the wing get caught, and have to fight in the horsemen fighting pits. Eventually their weapons are taken away because they're too good, and they have to kill by gouging out their opponents eyes with their bare hands. That was pretty gnarly.",Fantasy

That being said, there are passages of the Sanderson books that were written by Jordan, if you look closely you can probably spot them (it's not super noticable). One thing that struck me when I started Towers of Midnight was how seamless the transition is, there was never a point where things felt off or forced (as someone else pointed out, Mat was a little too jokey, but never to a point I'd consider the character ruined, or anything like that).  Sanderson, in my opinion, knocked it out of the park. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who could have done a better job.",Fantasy

Malice is probably the most 'traditional'out of the three in terms of feel and storyline. It's got some classic fantasy tropes in there - prophecy, coming of age character learning they have a greater destiny - but does enough with them to not feel predictable. It has plenty of intrigue and action, and I like to think of it as a fast paced Game of Thrones-lite (which does unfortunately mean a few too many characters and locations are introduced in the first half of the book). Of all three, if you are looking for something that best captures wider elements of heroic fantasy, it's your best bet.

Kings of the Wyld is not quite a parody, but it's definitely not the most serious of books. It's fun, filled with magic and monsters and larger than life characters, as well as loads of references to classic rock. If you want to read a book that is more often silly than serious (although it does have its moments) then go for this one.

The Blade Itself is actually somewhat deconstructive of many fantasy tropes (to say which would be a spoiler). It's dark, but often funny, and all the characters are bastards, yet still you somehow root for all of them by the end. The series is definitely more character focused than plot focused, which some people find off-putting, and it can seem slow at times. If you want something morally grey, with a black comedy-esq sense of humour, try this one.

But my main piece of advice is to just try something out, and if it isn't working for you by the time you get 25-35% of the way through, try something else. All three books you've listed have very different experiences in store for you, and that's still a tiny subset of different fantasy genres and styles.",Fantasy
8320,"The style is not similar, but Sanderson generally writes in an ""invisible"" commercial prose style, and honors some of Jordan's tics (""she folded her arms beneath her breasts..."") so unless you're extremely focused on prose constructions, you won't notice.

If you are extremely focused on prose constructions, it will feel like a lot of what was present in Jordan's prose is missing from Sanderson's.  Their phraseology is not similar.",Fantasy
8321,"I would say The Broken Empire trilogy by Mark Lawrence. I barley finished the first book because for me it was like reading fanfiction of an edgy 14 year old kid that wrote about himself as the main character that somehow leads a band of cutthroat bandits, kills without a thought and etc. But I got hooked at the end of the first book and starting with the second book with every page the story got better and better. You start to understand Jorg, how he came to being this person and you see him grow as a character. By the end of the trilogy I actually really liked the character that I despised in the beginning",Fantasy
8322,"That’s especially important for WoT and ASoIaF because there are SO MANY characters that weave in and out of the narrative and show up books later with little to no introduction.  Slowing your reading and reading other series would really interfere with the already difficult task of keeping them together.  
All that being said, personally I find that I build ‘momentum’ as I work through a finished series.  Each event getting me more excited for the next!  Hopefully you’ll experience something similar where you really develop passion for the series you’re reading.
Also you have SO MANY good books ahead of you.  I’m jealous of you getting to read them for the first time!  Enjoy!",Fantasy
8323,"It starts out really good, but I must admit book 3 lost the pace for me, overall still very good books though.",Fantasy
8324,"I rather enjoyed the Unhewn Throne trilogy.  It's been getting a lot of flak, but I really enjoyed how the author's cosmology wove together deities, the development of living creatures, and magic.  Rarely do I enjoy how deities are done in Fantasy, and I thought he did a wonderful job of it.",Fantasy
8325,"You're going to wait a lot then, If I were you. I'd start right now. ASOIAF is a complete masterpiece.",Fantasy

I remember thinking, *Three days in a single battle for 500 pages? I think I'm bored by that...*

But every book had been amazing up till that point so I read it and immediately was like, *Oh, right! I love the first act of the movie Paths of Glory...*

Possibly my favorite book in the entire series.",Fantasy
8332,"I know that everybody hates talking about ASOIAF or GOT these days due to the books needing ages to finish and the show ending in a atrocious way. But that being said, the third book, A Storm of Swords, is one of the best books I have ever read. It is my favourite book currently and I've yet to run into a book that made me feel as much as that one. I've watched the show before reading the books and even then, I was completely blown away by it.",Fantasy

8337,"He said that he didn’t try to imitate Jordan’s style, but tried to find a middle ground between his own style and Jordan’s. I think he did a good job at this. I didn’t notice too much of a difference in the prose—it felt like a natural transition from one author to the other.",Fantasy

8339,I DNFed The Blade Itself several years ago. I just couldn't get into the story. Since it's so popular and I own a copy I want to give it a second try someday before totally writing it off,Fantasy
8340,"If you like that kind of story, you'd also maybe enjoy my personal favorite series Red Rising although it's a sci Fi space opera rather than a fantasy",Fantasy
8341,"First of all - welcome to the world of Fantasy! You'll love it. 

As for your choices - I have to admit, Abercrombie is the only one of those authors that I've read. But he is my favorite author, too, so I would definitely vote for that. After the trilogy, he wrote 3 standalone books in the same world, with some familiar characters showing up, and they're all great.

He also started a new trilogy last year, again in the same world but set ~30 years after the original trilogy. The second book just came out a couple of weeks ago, and the last one is scheduled for around the same time next year. 

Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say you can't go wrong with his books.",Fantasy
8342,"I've just finished The Rage of Dragons.  I loved it, cant wait for the next one.  The Way of Kings,  i've tried it twice and its just not for me.   In my opinion,  its way too slow and i dont feel close to the character.   

The thousand names was not bad at all.  The second book is in my "" to read list "".",Fantasy

“Squash One, Squash two, Squash three and on..”  and then Gansey and Adam just screaming “ NO!”",Fantasy
8345,"I finished this trilogy in mid-August. While I feel that the storytelling was adequate, the gratuitous and graphic violence, seems to have been taken to extremes. There are more than enough explicit and detailed descriptions of murder, dismemberment, torture, executions and other sadistic acts than are really needed to tell this story. Sometimes grisly depictions just get in the way of the reading experience and I was disappointed to find it a distraction several times.",Fantasy
8346,I'll add that to my next reading list! I honestly have a crush on Zendaya so that might be a large contributing factor 😂 have you seen Euphoria?,Fantasy
8347,"I didn't say it wasn't ok,  just that there's a specific sub for this exact thing.",Fantasy
8348,I'm not familiar with that actress but I'll look her up!!,Fantasy
8349,It was in there. Not like full porn scenes but I recall it being mentioned.,Fantasy
8350,"I think it's not generally portrayed how much crime there was. There was no ""police"" to protect individuals, they had to do it themselves.",Fantasy
8351,"The comparisons that made me think of Zendaya's character in Euphoria with Alex are the awkward/introverted/depressed/dark personality and then the drug addiction/fentanyl use sealed the image in my head. Also the darker/olive toned skin and otherwise arbitrarily described ethnicity left room for me to continue seeing Zendaya. But it could also be because I'm just a huge fan of Zendaya/slightly in love with her too.. 😅😂

Side note: what are your final thoughts on the book(without spoilers)??  I've heard really mixed reviews (most leaning on the negative side), but so far I've been enjoying it. It seems like the books main criticisms are lack of fantasy/magic in-depth world building, lack of actual plot, and slow paced read.",Fantasy
8352,My pleasure!,Fantasy
8353,It also has The Cleric Quintet so not all Drizzt. The Cleric Quintet is really amazing work.,Fantasy
8354,"Yep! It’s a complete, four-book series. Excellent stuff, though I’ll warn you that it gets VERY dark. 

Gap is indeed SF. It’s the best space opera I’ve ever read. Super intense, and like Caine, has some really disturbing things that happen to the main characters.",Fantasy
8355,"If I was excited for more books in this series, I didn’t show it.

Hey, I’m all for it if it comes out as refined as The Emperor’s Blades; however, I currently don’t trust Staveley to properly handle a trilogy-length character arc.  The last trilogy really felt like he was making it up as he went along; so many threads were dropped and shifted between installments.  If that’s his approach here as well, I won’t be tuning in.",Fantasy
8356,"Yeah, I was picturing more the ""Gandalf the Grey"" age group (so thousands of years old).",Fantasy
8357,"First I appreciate your education, second I want to clarify that my definition of normal does not coincide with my definition of good, as a student of psychology and a person who has the ability to get people to tell dirty secrets, I saw how people are much more amoral than they tell themselves. In the case of Dresden he is being influenced by a fallen angel and the grace of his character is that he is a person who despite his evil does good. When what I see in my immediate surroundings is exactly the opposite, this generated in me a great admiration for a character like him, if you don't want in your forum such a negative view about the world i will understand it and again, thanks for the education",Fantasy

8366,"Read Snakewood by Adrian Selby. It's... quite gut-twisting, gut-wrenching, pulls no punches, and will make you cry. Very brutal. More books are in the works too.

8369,I've read 157 pages of Jade City and I'm loving it. It's really a gangstermoviesetup with cool magic!,Fantasy
8370,They made huge character decisions BETWEEN books too.  Adare was constantly pulling 180s; her Book 2 prophet story played NO role in the 3rd book.  I often think of the series as discovery writing gone bad.,Fantasy
8371,"I will say this is my favorite book by Joe. I’ve read and listened to the audiobook multiple times. Friendly, and Cosca together in a book is just the most hilarious combination ever. Also Shivers is my fav Character and he gets plenty of action time here, if you look 👀 closely — no pun intended. 

However, a lot of people find the story a bit too predictable. Basically it’s a revenge tail and some people don’t like that after Monza kills her first two enemies that you kinda know she’ll kill the remainder too. But there are some surprises too and the humor to me is just outstanding. The audiobook is very good too btw. But yeah my sister hated the book she thought it was too predictable. I think people just really have different opinions on this one. To me it’s like a Quentin Terrentino revenge tail with lots of humor.",Fantasy
8372,I remember lots of gratuitous violence but I loved these books. Definitely not perfect but I thought it was a fun story and a great world he built.,Fantasy
8373,"I read Assasin's Apprentice and liked it. But wasn't that thrilled. I did not find any major attachment to any character. The story was interesting but I felt the ending, that was very complicated, was conveniently ""fixed"" in an irrational matter. I've read so many amazing reviews that I always asked myself, did I read the same book?  I never had any desire to pick up book 2, but I might have to give the series a 2nd shot.  Idk, its been a long time and maybe I'm just not remembering it correctly. 
Glad you found joy in it, theres such an uplifting feeling when you like a series and cant stop reading/thinking about it. Enjoy!",Fantasy
8374,"For something different and fun perhaps try Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames. Part of a series but reads like a standalone with great friendships.  Could work well for your s a palette cleanser. 

I also just started Jade City by Fonda Lee so I can't vouch for the quality throughout but think gangsters with magic in the 50's isch. So far I'm loving it and that it is very different from other things I've read recently.",Fantasy
8375,I though Gwenna similarly got the short stick.  Staveley has her spend 90% of the book (a LONG  672 page book) rebuilding to Kettral &gt;!only to have them all thrown into a blender in a single scene.!&lt;  What a waste of my time.,Fantasy
8376,"Eh.  *Changes* represented a change in the nature of the series, not just in the life of the protagonist.  Tastes vary, and I sympathize with people who found the shift not what they'd hoped, but the apples-and-oranges nature of the transformation makes it hard to compare what went before with what came after.",Fantasy

8384,"It was my first Tolkien book I’ve read. Worth every frank I spent on it. If you want tragedy, you’re going to be served.

8385,"It is. Posts like these are fine, always happy to help with fantasy suggestions. We are a great sub to chat and talk with.",Fantasy
8386,I agree! But for me Ghost story was also a slight stepdown from the ever rising quality.,Fantasy
8387,"Many fantasies books do a great job telling coming of age stories set in inhumanly tough exclusive academies or schools where future warriors and leaders are trained

In the Emperor’s Blade, Staveley manages to create two of the most interesting of all time and tell parallel stories of two brothers attending one each. The Shin and the Kettral’s training methods both last in my memory.

These types of settings are my favorite fantasy trope, I hope we see more in this next trilogy.",Fantasy

8405,"Locke Lamora. I think there is one or two books left to be released in the series right?

I read ROTE a while ago, so not really.

Also, I appreciate you not biting my head off for my comment. We all like different styles and I appreciate Hobb wrote a very successful series in ROTE, and as I mentioned there were parts i loved about it.

I think it is more just a build up of series that I have enjoyed, but haven't quite given me the satisfaction of reading a book where I feel things went crazy, unexpected, truly got me emotional and jaw droppingly magnificent. 

I am on the final book of the Dark Tower (well got a few connected books to read before the final book). 

And I think this gave me a taste of both worlds with salems lot, wizard and glass, the stand which i thourghly enjoyed. As well as the first two books.

But it also hit me with the opposite in the other books. With that feeling that characters stroll through the story kicking down doors and defying death with the authors/Ka's protection. 

Feels too much like something is happening but nothing really is, because they got this protection.

I have high hopes for the final book and a big satisfying ending.

Sounds like I want a huge body count in the series I read. That isn't the case. Rarther I want to feel the journey a novel takes me through is genuinely as tough as it makes out, that the protagonist is actually as cunning and ruthless as the author tries to make out...and for that I think you do need the right amount of tragedy and sacrifice of some sort.",Fantasy

I read your edit and now I can't shake the feeling that it sounds like you studied Rome and tried to force everything into fitting what you read. The feeling that you started with the conclusion and tried to find the supporting evidence after, while not eliminating the evidence against it (for example, evidence towards it being closer to Renaissance, which is the dominant view).

You made some bad (simplified or flat out wrong) assumptions about medieval Europe and arbitrarily hyper-focused on some aspects (military) while brushing others aside as costumes or just ignoring them (slavery).

Overall, I think this stuff is fun to think about, so thank you for bringing up the topic! I just worry that some people will only read the original post and walk out with the wrong impression of Fantasyland, medieval Europe and Rome.",Fantasy

Just recently I have found it has gotten boring. When you know 95% of characters will get through with a tap on the wrist. The plot can often, not always, become predictable in that you know they will succeed in overcoming almost all obstacle. Ie character gets captured, you know they will get saved. Character gets ambushed, you know they will scrap through. Feels like the writer is trying to build suspence/tension, but doesn't quite reach me because the characters seem untouchable.

I also think it reduces the seriousness of danger of the villan. The BBEG, super powerful threating to destroy the current way of life across the world....ending....BBEG and all his thousands of minions die whilst all the heroes walk away....sure, that sounds like a legit powerful protagonist.",Fantasy

""The Dunyain seek absolute awareness, the self-moving thought. The thoughts of all men arise from the darkness. If you are the movement of your soul and the cause of that movement precedes you, how can you call your thoughts your own. How can you be anything other than a slave to darkness that comes before ?

The world slumbers in ignorance. Only the Dunyain are awake."" - Anasurimbor Kellhus",Fantasy

I wrote this slightly different ending originally with a big ol' fight between Eska and Josef. It was pretty cool, but didn't really work as well as the less actiony one. But really, I'm not really one for cutting lots. I tend to write space and add scenes later.

I add little homages in to all my books. Usually taking the form of references to the stuff that inspired me. So yes, there are some hidden in there.

I want to be optimistic but I don't know. The original trilogy took a nosedive once it stopped being about the Bird Squad.

8564,Honestly as someone whos read ASOIAF multiple times A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings are my least favourite of the main series because of how dry they are. A Storm of Swords is when GRRM started livening things up by adding in more humour and action.,Fantasy

8567,"The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison deals with very low stakes: it's a slice of life fantasy about a goblin who unexpectedly becomes emperor and then tries to do as good a job as possible in the rest of the book. I think the most high stakes like thing that happens is an assassination attempt.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels usually also deal with fairly small stakes, especially the Watch series books. Its mostly the Watch trying to protect their city. The series starts with Guards! Guards!

Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere deals with a man trying to get home after accidentally ending up in a strange world.",Fantasy

There are a few books that I think I would have loved if I had read them near the start of my adventures into fantasy.
Most notably wheel of time, which everyone seems to live but I wasn't completely head over heels for. Decent series for sure, but no where close to things like first law, malazan, fifth season imo

Best example is i read throne of glass (a teen fantasy of all things) very early on and actually enjoyed it quite a bit...but reading it now, I think I would be bored mindless.

In book 2 he’s ideals sets him against his sister and a few superiors in bird military. Basically book 1 and 2 he’s a guy who has to deal with some tough situation and him and his bird military friends face those things together and are interesting and have a great dynamic. Book 2 ends with him getting his ass kicked and separated from his buddies. Book 3 is “I lost a fight and have lost my eyes. Now I couldn’t give two shits about the country, my duty, bird buddies, my family, or being a decent well together human being. I’m going to join a pretty lame masochistic horse tribe and have sex with a pretty lame masochistic older gal and be angry at my sister.” The book ends with him like that, he abandons his bird homies and stays with the masochist people.

Malazan I’m kind of neutral about. There are things I really really loved but those were things that Erikson just didn’t want to write about so I’d slog through things *I* didn’t really care about for the few moments he would develop the things I was interested in before finally deciding what he made and what I felt were good were so far from each other.

I also was never really a big fan of King’s writing style or story telling. I can appreciate what he makes and how he’s become such a home name but I only really read his short stories or The Stand and the latter I tend to just enjoy as a collection of interconnected stories.",Fantasy

First three books = brilliant! Loved them. Didnt expect what happened, characters sacrificed and great ending.

Short stories = again loved them. Quick reads but very satisfying and original.

The rest of the 13 or so books are literally the definition of what I am trying to avoid xD ...predictable and soft. Being 100% honest here, when anything happened the first ""I think this is probably going to happen in this arch"" was what ended up happening...and I am not the most imaginative guy. Ofcourse there were a few things/relationships that caught me out, but I am speaking of the whole picture.

Dont get me wrong. The concepts where amazing, but the characters and story after the first three were so predictable and bland, and I did not find them interesting (was listening to audiobooks at x2 speed by the end. :X

Note - I have been told I missed some of the key character development Hobb focused on...but even so...not my cup of tea - don't know if you can tell :P

8690,"It's been a while for me, too, since, you know, I didn't feel any great love for the series after the torture porn. Basically, one of the leeches runs off of emotion, and quickly discovers that torturing people is the best way to fuel his abilities. So he tortures the shit out of Valyn's love interest, then kills her. Later, tortures dozens (hundreds?) of people just for the fun of it.

The more egregious example, though, is when Valyn goes blind in Book 3 but discovers that pain and hatred can cause him to see for a brief period of time. So he hooks up with a local priestess/shaman lady who worships pain and the two proceed to have a BDSM/torture porn f***fest for much of Book 3. It was all just...thoroughly unnecessary.",Fantasy
8691,"Anything by Brandon Sanderson just feels stilted and forced to me, though I forgive him for how he finished Wheel Of Time - much as he dropped the quality - because that is a difficult thing to pull off and it had to be done. 

The Poppy War was unreadable.

Dune was unreadable, though I respect that it’s been ripped off by many quality writers.

David Eddings is a bad writer, full stop. He also is a monster who went to prison because he and his wife were keeping their children in a cage. Don’t spend money on his work, don’t suggest that people read it. Let him be forgotten.

The Goblin Emperor felt like it was almost a good book but got lost in itself with its emphasis on world building through character titles and forms of address. I felt the same about The Long Price series; after the hundredth time I read that someone “took a pose of questioning, with serious intent, but a hint of childlike wonder crossed with the need to hold in a fart” I put it away.",Fantasy

When I moved to my current location there were two great used bookstore that had sci-fi/fant sections and I stumbled on the Darkover series. I bought the first in the series (used) and a lot of the rest of the series was just there on the shelf. I loved the first book, went back for the second, third, then gave up and bought the shelf :).

Sure, when we look at how fantasy evolved over the years, with complex worldbuilding and interesting magic systems, from authors like Sanderson and Rothfuss, you could argue the Drizzt books are just generic adventures, with good old fashioned heroes and villains, sword fights etc.

8770,"I think Malazan is almost a given as the great marmite of fantasy.

The Goblin Emperor is the current book I'm really struggling with. Too many charecters with too many names. Only the MC really has a character and it's limp. It seems to just be insecurity and applying the moral judgements of some in the 20th century to something more akin to the 17th. It comes across as hollow.

They said it's interesting as it is the politics of manners, which is an unusual subgenre and it could just be that's not my bag. From what I've heard I really need to read wolf hall to properly be able to judge it against similar novels.

The poppy war I really enjoyed the school.training stuff until it became an elaborate second world war in an alternate world story. I could respect it just not my thing.

8779,"Eska and I, we're not the best match. 

Rob writes like a pro and has a knack for creating addictive page-turners. I think *Along The Razor's Edge* is a great book, but also the one I couldn't stand at times because of how strongly Eska irked me as a POV.

It was definitely character-driven but I found the protagonist loathsome and self-centered. It shouldn't, perhaps, come as a surprise given the bleak circumstances, but I can't say I wished her well. Eska has zero problems with using people, both friends, and foes. It doesn't sit well with me.  
All that said, she is memorable. In an over-the-top way but it still counts :)

Honourable mentions to Jack Vance's Dying Earth stories, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings, Joe Abercrombie's The First Law, Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle and George R.R.

I solved this issue with audiobooks. It is easier for me to digest these books in audio form. It's this way for two reasons. 1) I don't have to sit down to read it, I can listen to it when I'm in the car or at work or doing chores, etc. and 2) Having a narrator helps me visualize and get lost in the world more. It's like a really long campfire story.

Thanks to that I can read things like Mistborn or the Kingkiller Chronicles and get through other books that are on my TBR and I wouldn't be able to give a fair chance by not reading analog.

8805,"Yes, this one right here. It’s a perfect fit for what you’re after.

You may also like Joe Abercrombie’s work, specifically the First Law trilogy and its companion books in the same universe. (I haven’t -yet- read his more recent work, but I would bet it also fits to a large degree.) The First Law trilogy is all about subverting fantasy tropes, so there’s a lot of heroes not obtaining their goals, the ones they do obtain turning out to be not so heroic, and getting really beat up (physically and emotionally) or killed along the way. Characters are fallible, they make real sacrifices which sometimes don’t work out, and can be their own worst enemy with tragic consequences.

Jade City and Jade War by Fonda Lee also fit the bill. It’s set in an Asian-inspired Island nation that is run by competing mafia clans that can use jade, a stone found only on their island, to gain physical powers. The main characters, part of the ruling family of one of the mafia clans, have the admirable goal of protecting each other and their family and clan’s interests, but each has their own way of handling things and their own special interests. It’s a time of upheaval as the country transitions into the second generation after a successful war of independence with continued political pressure from outside and inside.

The ""peasants with swords"" line was just a lighthearted simplification, and when I said there were no formations, I meant that they were less defined than those of legionaries. Instead of a precise number of ranks and files, drilled for complex maneuvers on command, you had vaguely rectangular blobs with some basic commands like ""shield wall.""

My line about logistics was a simplification, too. Medieval armies supplemented forage with extensive baggage trains and the services of camp followers; Roman armies reduced their reliance on trains by arranging detailed supply lines free through depots and old castra, allowing them to field larger armies and operate in winter (by keeping up a flow of food and fodder).",Fantasy

I was puzzled that W. Somerset Maugham was still on his feet, much less getting into self-publishing under 'Rob J. Hayes'.  The moderators have explained my confusion, as they often do. Ha. No problem.   

**Questions for Hayes/Maughham**:    

*   Both Eska and Larry Darrell are traumatized by the horrors of war. At it's end he goes to climb mountains; she's thrown down a pit. Larry will descend the mountain *enlightened*. Would you say Eska shall *ascend* the pit enlightened?  or do you feel such philosophy is best left to the explication of pure action?   

*   When writing characters whose motivations are chiefly anger, rage &amp; the determination to survive, do you ever feel echoes of those dark emotions? Or should the determination to survive even be classed as a dark emotion?

*   Do you think the moderators will let me take the exam as pass/fail?

*'Along the Razor's Edge'* seems one of those books sufficiently professional as to be meaningless to classify as 'self-published'. Best classify a book like a protagonist; by their qualities, not their origins.",Fantasy

8831,"LotR isn't really a long series. It's only a trilogy, and even then not a very huge trilogy (by modern standards). Generally, with shorter series, you could mix and match different series if you think sticking with the same series for an extended period of time will bore you. 

Personally, I wouldn't do that with long series. WoT, for instance, is 14 books. If you go a long period between books, you could end up forgetting some details. 

My recommendation: read the series together. LotR is not that long and shouldn't be difficult to finish, so go with that first. For WoT, it's definitely a much longer commitment due to the length. I would still recommend reading them all, but consider reading something in between if it seems like you're ""burning out"" in the series. But even if you do that, don't go for another series, because that would require a commitment itself. Maybe a standalone.

ASOIAF does have religions, but they never feel like they are as important to the characters as it was to actual medieval people. Admittedly this is a hard thing to do right, because it limits the kind of stories you can tell. 

Racism among the “good guys” 

Medieval people were very racist. Early modern Europe had slave traders like John Hawkins and Francis Drake who were celebrated as national heroes. I don't need people to be racist to enjoy a story and it only bothers me when a villain is depicted as racist and all of the sudden the whole book is about how racism is bad.

8896,"&gt;Soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horses

If we're talking levied peasants, it'd be spears, or farm tools if anything.  Swords were, even among wealthier soldiers, typically a sidearm.  Pole weapons were almost always the primary weapon of the melee fighter, because as it turns out, swords aren't very effective against armor unless you go for joints or other exposed areas (hard facepalm every time I see a sword cut through boiled leather, maille, or plate as if it isn't there).  Spears are also easier to learn to use, and more effective for formation fighting, because yes, formations were still a thing in the Middle Ages. A disorganized mob doing whatever is going to get deleted by an even slightly organized mob that's working together.

&gt;Little to no logistical support or organization

I take issue with this because an army larger than a raiding party with no logistical support is not going to get very far outside of its kingdom.  You can only forage so much, and under- or unfed soldiers are not happy soldiers.  Wagon trains of supplies (and sometimes buying supplies from locals to restock them) were absolutely essential to the army of any time period, and attacking that instead of the army itself, if pulled off successfully, was more strategic than attacking the army itself.",Fantasy
8897,"The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb

About half of this series (three out of five arcs) are told from the POV of Fitz Farseer from his childhood to his older days, and while Fitz himself is a great character (although he suffers a lot) I think what makes the RotE great is all the other characters and how real they are and feel. As Fitz change so do they, both in how Fitz (and therefore you) perceive them but also because they aren't written as secondary characters but as beings of their own with their own dreams and goals. Also, the best animal companion ever written. 

The Long Price Quartet by Daniel Abraham

Another slow, character driven story, this time following Ota Machi's life in four books separated by 15 years each. The magic system that is both terrifyingly beautiful and so unique might be what makes this series so good in my eyes, but honestly if you don't mind books with little action this quartet is as close to perfection as you can get. 

The Gentleman Bastard by Scott Lynch

Locke Lamora might be a thief, a conman, a murderer, but the one thing he is above all is entertaining. You follow him and his friends as they are raised by the charismatic Father Chains, a false priest of a nameless god, to steal from the rich and use that money to, well, steal more from the rich. The charisma of Locke and Chains is one of the most interesting aspects of these books, but the dialogues (especially the banter) are top notch and the deeply complex underworld of the vibrant cities they visit are also part of what makes these books great. 

The Riyria Revelations by Michael J. Sullivan

Featuring one of the best duos of Fantasy, the positive paladin Hadrian Blackwater and the resentful rogue Royce Melburn as they are dragged into a conspiracy that could bring the entire world to its knees. These books are a lot faster pace than everything else I listed prior, but they are a really fun read.

I feel that after he had that accident (van ran him over) he worked like crazy to get the story done.

8944,"Yup. It's pretty easy to see immediately when starting the books. The north part of middle earth is a wilderness with no real borders and no kingdoms, and while the king (of Arnor) is occasionally mentioned, people have no grasp of what the kingdom is, because they don't always seem to know that it collapsed long ago (the hobbits especially mention the king as if he has just neglected to collect taxes in a while, and not that he was killed and his people scattered).

Similarly, Rivendell, Mirkwood, Dale, and the lonely mountain are all towns/villages/cities with a small unofficial area of influence. They're not exactly kingdoms and their differences are cultural, not nationalistic.

It's only in the south that Lothlorien (maybe), Mordor, Rohan and Gondor seem to have proper kingdoms, borders, and national identities.",Fantasy

I liked him quite a lot because he was still a decent person, even amidst all the hardship. &gt;!I had really hoped that he would somehow follow the others and that they would make up and was quite shocked by his death. Poor poor Josef...!&lt; 

I wouldn‘t have minded if the book had been longer and featured more background info on the world and on Eska‘s past. Her description of how she grew up were the parts of the book that I enjoyed most. And I also felt like we just barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer.

To be blunt, I think his blog is amazing but he overrates ASOIAF logistics. The upcoming siege of Winterfell for example, is narratively exciting but involves armies smaller than a Roman legion. 


Aside from the weird and monstrous size of House Tyrell, ASOIAF armies are not all that large. We are talking about 20,000 men being a large host for either Lannister or Stark or Baratheon. The only large battle in series so far is at the Blackwater, and it is comparable to large battles such as Baghdad or Constantinople. 

While European armies drastically expanded after around 1500, High Medieval armies could marshal moderately large armies. Recall that England was a backwater, the farther east we go, the larger polities and armies generally get. The Ottomans could sometimes muster 80,000 men for large jihads, and the French threw 40,000 or more men-at-arms in the English and Italian wars. Even the much derided Holy Roman Empire apparently could muster 60,000 during the Hussite Wars. And this is all prior to 1500.",Fantasy

9001,"Counterpoint: we're denigrating the High Middle Ages somewhat too much, and ASOIAF jives pretty fine with 14th CE medieval history. 


If you read any good book about the 100 Years War or War of the Roses, you'd see plenty of international influences from Lombard banker and Flemish wool merchant interests. To say nothing of the Catholic Church. This was a complex geopolitical era too, and the dynastic struggle of House Plantagenet was between the lines dictated by economic concerns more than simple familial vendetta.  

People weren't primitive fools in the High Middle Ages. If anything, Europe's economy by 1300 was as if not more complex than anything of the Roman era (whose main non-agricultural economy was focused on the East). Feels like this thread is lurching to an extreme that resembles Renaissance archetypes of Medieval primitivism and the myth of the 1000 year long Dark Ages, rather than anything based on sound history.",Fantasy
9002,"That’s the general theme of this whole thread though, isn’t it? Things that are missing from European Middle Ages-inspired fantasy, which has expanded into the reverse, anachronistic things that have been included.

If the setting is a different world with Middle Ages flavor, I completely agree, and ‘anachronistic’ is meaningless because it’s not our world with our history. But if the setting is using real-world places, peoples, and general history  (in this case eg. Ulster, Britons, etc.) in my opinion as a reader  there needs to be an in-story reason to bring in anachronistic stuff.",Fantasy

9013,"&gt;In the end, do you feel it was a character- or plot-driven book?

The plot mostly consisted of ""whatever bullshit Eska is pulling and the consequences of it"" so yeah, I'm going with character-driven.

&gt;Was it entertaining? Was it immersive? Was it emotionally engaging?

Yeah, I enjoyed it. The gloominess and brutality of The Pit definitely came through and the hints and clues at future events hooked me on the world and characters quickly and thoroughly. Is the desire to strangle Eska for being a fool considered an emotion? If so, yes, very emotionally engaging.

&gt;What did you think of the book's length? If too long, what would you cut? Too short, what would you add?

It read quickly, for sure, and the pacing kept me coming back for more whenever I set the book down. Obviously as a first book in a series there's plenty more story to be told, but I felt it worked well as a intro to the series and felt like it told a complete story in itself as well.

&gt;Would you read another book by this author? Why or why not?

Certainly! He's been on my list of authors to follow since I enjoyed *Never Die* last year.

I did post a full review a week or so back, but I'll put my more spoilery thoughts here, since I try to trim those out of reviews. It's interesting to me that I enjoyed this one as much as I did, with how irritating Eska can be. I'm attributing it to the first-person voice being compelling, as well as the characters around her. I'm still on Josef's side, he had a much more reasonable and responsible approach to their situation, and I still think he deserved better (way better, considering &gt;!his unfortunate demise!&lt;). However, I think by having Eska as the lead and making the decisions she makes, we got a more unique/interesting perspective than we would have had with a story where Josef made the decisions and got his way. Still, I hate Eska a little for how she treated him and for her justifications for it (the whole betrayal narrative she keeps coming back to is tiresome and pretty thin, in my opinion). It's proof of the book's success that I can still get riled up talking about Eska several weeks after finishing it, I suppose.

If Rob is around, I would like to put on record that I did actually get to play Trust with a group and did not lose any friends in the process. I think the key to keeping friends is to be less terrible than Eska (not a very high bar, that). Hilariously, I have a friend who argued that there is no point in ever choosing ""friendship"" on the dice, so I'll be keeping an eye on him for other Eska-like qualities in the future. And, since I don't think I've asked you my usual author question: If you could spend a day with one of your characters, who would you choose and why? What would the two of you do?",Fantasy

9028,"Sorry, should have been more clear. Catherine de Medici was the effective ruler of France as the mother of successive kings Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III, all her sons who kept dying.  She never succeeded as formal Queen Regnant the way Cersei does in the show, but she had a/the major ruling power via her children.

In the books Cersei certainly takes power after the death of Tywin in her role as mother of the 9-year old Tommen. She uses that power to elevate the High Sparrow and his militant faith as part of a cynical plan to use them against her enemies, which rebounds spectacularly on her. 

Catherine de Medici first became a power when her husband died and her 15-year old son became king (Francis II). When Francis II died, her younger son Charles IX became king and she became regent. 

During this period, France was engaged in a series of religious civil wars between Catholic and Protestant Huguenots. Catherine was a Catholic, but more interested in political power than faith. Still, she is known as having unleashed religious fanaticism in her cause--she is often blamed for the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in Paris and around France when hundred of Huguenots were killed on the same day protestant Henry of Navarre married the king's sister Margaret.

(Eventually Henry of Navarre would win the War of the Three Henrys and become Henry IV of France, ending the violence and coming to be known as one of France's greatest leaders).

This is probably not a popular opinion. 

I loved *Daughter of the Empire* and finished it in a day. I gave up on *Servant of the Empire* towards the end of the book. Mara's romantic pursuits overwhelmed her character and the story. Her mental toughness, brilliant political maneuvering and grey moral character made the first book very compelling. 

In the second book, I had to read about yearning and erections and page after page of Mara flopping around on cushions worrying about love triangle problems. She was petulant and self-indulgant and I found myself not liking her all that much anymore.  Some POVs were worse than Mara's. The bad guys were laughably predictable. They just sat at tables or walked around properties info-dumping their plans and had extremely edgy bad guy hobbies.

This isn't a troll question.     I've generally disliked most traditional western ""Epic"" fantasy series,   but I have really enjoyed some longer Wuxia-style epics.  (Most notably, I loved the hell out of The Brightest Shadow) 

Does this book have anything in common with the sort of pacing/storytelling that the latter genre has?  

This book gets recommended to people as ""like Sanderson"" but at least from the blurb on the back, it doesn't sound all that similar to stuff he's written.     Is that just something people say because they know it sounds appealing and will get people to read the book?

I only eventually picked up the first one because I felt I should read a female author for once because I noticed my most recent reads and much of by TBR were by men. I don't usually give too much thought towards that sort of thing but for some reason, it felt right to pick a female author this time. I landed on Hobb because I kept seeing so much love for them. 

I read the first few chapters and was unmoved by them. I put the book down for a month. Really glad I didn't forget them entirely. Annoyed at myself because I kept seeing so many comments on Reddit bursting with love for them, I picked it back up trying to figure out what the heck I was missing. Then maybe one more chapter, at most two, from where I left off had me hooked and swooning. Just like that. I proceeded to devour them.

9066,"I see what you mean but I think, if anything, it’s a mixture. 

Some misconceptions: 

Medieval agriculture was generally more advanced than Roman agriculture especially for Northern Europe. Items such as the heavy plough were invented in the medieval period. Romans did have control of his area but their hearts were in the Mediterranean, which has a lot of relatively fertile lands that didn’t need all the work. 

Rome was able to have such large cities because they had *so much* fertile land in their possession and were able to import grain from them. Egypt and Sicily fed the empire. Constantinople fell off population wise for a lot of reasons but part of it was losing Egypt and, much earlier, Sicily. They could no longer feed a massive city because they lost their bread baskets not because they lost technology. 

Also, polytheistic religions existed well into the Middle Ages. The Lithuanians didn’t stop practicing their native faith until the 14th century. The Norse people not until the 10th. It’s not just a Roman thing. 

Career soldiers were absolutely a thing in the Middle Ages. Mercenaries were very common through out the Middle Ages. I can’t think of many Medieval English kings who didn’t utilize them heavily starting with at least Henry I. By the end of the period they made up the bulk of many armies. And you had the famous Swedish pike men.

Logistics and supply lines were a thing in the Middle Ages. Very hit or miss, to be sure. But men like Richard I and Henry V were geniuses at this. 

It’s definitely true of career diversity (although again this was allowed because they were being fed by regions like Egypt and Sicily.) But the middle ages weren’t static. There was more career diversity as the time went on. 

Before the recent obsession with a fetishized Dark Ages aesthetic I’d say most classic fantasy was loosely based on High and Late Middle Ages were things like careers, career soldiers, logistics and supply lines, and other aspects are more likely.",Fantasy

I stopped because there’s this weirdly socially conservative bent to the whole thing. It shows up in gender roles, family units, the in-universe talkshow on the TV, and the absence of anyone other than straight white people. At first I thought “It’s Iceland, of course there’s white people and I probably don’t understand the culture” but I think it goes beyond that. And this criticism is from someone who liked the comparable webcomic Unsounded, which has a lot of horribly backwards characters yet still manages to put their flaws in interesting lights.

9087,"&gt;I'd also argue that from a military standpoint at least, the advent of gunpowder changed things drastically in the Renaissance from what fantasy settings normally depict.

Can you expand on this? I assume you don't mean the technology itself, because Romans didn't have a lot of the technology that is featured in fantasy (the kinds of armors and arms, stirrups, castles etc.). If you allow that part to be a reskinned Roman setting, it would make sense to also allow cannons and muskets to be reskinned to medieval. So what differences do you mean?

I think you made a good case for why classic fantasy isn't accurate to medieval Europe (which is a really common, uncontroversial take), but you didn't make a good case for why it is Roman *and not something else.* The period people usually compare it to is Rennaissance/early modern, like /u/Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho said.

That matches almost every point you made, already has the right aesthetics (plate armor is closer to Renaissance, for example), and also gives you extra features like guilds and the absence of slavery.

Edit: also, I don't think your line is very consistent. Why are military ranks a point towards Roman armies but noble titles something added on? Couldn't it be medieval with added on Roman army structure by the same logic? What counts as ""costumes""?",Fantasy

To the OP’s point, there is a lot of Roman influence in classic ‘medieval’ fantasy because it was inspired but medieval literature not necessarily medieval history. Medieval romances, histories, hagiographies, etc often told stories set in their past, many of which retelling Roman history. Romans like Virgil, Pliny, Cicero were widely read in medieval scholarly circles and were huge influences on medieval philosophy and learning. Even when inspired by history, historical periods don’t have clear cut offs. The Roman period and the so-called ‘dark ages’ (early Middle Ages) overlap.

Which is almost impossible for a European or American to comprehend. That within living memory, people didn't go outside at night because the moon was the only light and there were animals that would kill you.

9226,"SA is notably different from Sanderson's earlier work. Mistborn, Elantris and Warbreaker can all be understood as set-piece fiction revolving around a single basic question. What if the dark lord won? What if ruling Demigods suddenly get depowered? Warbreaker is a bit more muddled with the premise, but still has a similar dynamic with limited area and different viewpoints. 

SA is very different. It's a whole world and the author actively tries to obfuscate the premise. You will get there at the end of book 3. Meaning the thing is also slow. The main characters do not even meet in the first book. Also the world is more alien and full of magic than in the other books.

You'll discover that almost all modern portrayals of ""Medieval"" life are wildly off, and not really in the way that you think. The only one I've found that I really recommend for authenticity is the video game Kingdom Come: Deliverance. 

As for where our classic ""Medieval"" fantasy tropes come from, there are for sure some similarities with Roman times, but most of the trappings themselves tend to come from early modern Europe, which was itself heavily influenced by Roman art and thinking. From what I can tell, the classic Western ""Medieval"" fantasy setting emerged from early 1900s writers ideas of what Medieval life was like, which was itself influenced by (very inaccurate) Victorian historical thinking. Then that was all mashed together in a stew of anachronisms and nationalism.",Fantasy

9242,"Though, didn't the post-Roman kingdoms and their successors for the most part lack training and experience as large-scale (1,000+ soldiers) forces, as compared to Roman and Byzantine armies?

In the Early Empire, large scale training was left to the discretion and direction of the governors appointed by the Emperor to his provinces, but ideally an imperial governor should be drilling their forces in large scale maneuvers fairly regularly during their tenure. So there would be plenty of small field armies most having one legion (~4,500) supported by roughly its number again in auxiliaries training together for an army of around 10,000 or two legions with auxiliaries bringing the number up to 20,000 soldiers that would be drilling together if the governor felt like doing it or the Emperor came around for inspections ala Hadrian.

In the Late Empire, border units were broken up into forces of a 1,000 or less and administrative and logistical tasks left to specialized officials to make it harder for officials to rebel and challenge the Emperor. Border forces could come together temporarily under higher level commanders or an Emperor's personal direction, but they would be unlikely to train in larger groups as that might cast suspicion upon them. The Emperors would maintain grand retinues of 10,000+ soldiers who would be trained in large scale maneuvers, allowing the Emperors to firstly discourage or defeat usurpers and secondarily to fight off ""barbarian"" adversaries.

The Byzantines kept the Late Roman grand retinues based around the person of the remaining Roman Emperor in Constantinople which depending on what estimates you use consisted of between 10,000 soldiers on the low end to 40,000 soldiers on the high end. While the theme system was reasonably intact, most soldiers were *themata* who would partially sustain themselves by farming (and thus time not training for individual, small-scale, or large-scale combat) and kept in generally smaller units where possible to discourage rebellion.

Edward I's household maintained perhaps 300 or so people who could serve in war permanently around the person of the king. There were lots of small units in the dozens or hundreds based around aristocrats and royals in the period, but the largest permanent units would probably be the few Late Medieval mercenary companies that could maintain themselves by traveling off to fight another war when their current one ended or met a truce or just through pillaging and hostage-taking in the lands of their former employers. A few such companies would maintain a thousand or more soldiers under arms continuously which would facilitate large-scale training, but it's only at the tail end of the period that rulers outside of Byzantium would start forming standing armies maintained in large units as with the ordonnance companies of France.",Fantasy

The sequels to 2001 are not terrible. They’re not great. If you love Arthur C. Clarke’s writing, they should hold you just fine. But they do suffer from diminishing returns because the ‘big reveal’ of each successive book can never be as original or jarring as the first book’s.",Fantasy

I'll be honest, while I'm a huge Sanderson fan, Warbreaker is not one of my favorites. So to compare Stormlight (my personal favorite) to Warbreaker wouldn't do it justice.

2. Despite being a Christian allegory, we also have the ""if you worship really really hard then I'll save you."" Ow that hurt.

3. Explicit mentions to things the problem of evil, then an incredibly weak one sided philosophical argument.

That's not how it works. You need ships for that kind of trading, and not many merchants could afford that. And that's why in the Middle Ages the Italians, and in particular Venetia, had trading empires. From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice had the monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian maritime republics and city-states.

9369,"Lots and lots of things. I divide it into two types- when authors doesn't know that things used to be fundamentally different and  when they do know but use wrong point of reference.
First type:

Lack of privacy. Most of characters have bedrooms or at least beds. Meanwhile in middle ages life used to be a group matters, even for the richest. Bedrooms in better houses were public space to conduct meetings and socialise and when night come people who did have beds  slept in them with servants and family. Same for bathing, eating and everything else, especially when resources were involved.

Cost of material things- from spoons to furniture, everything produced by artisans was more expensive and used till it felt off. People used to cont everything including needles in their wills. On the other hand people aspired to live comfortably and look as good as they could afford.

Light- candles are not lightbulbs. Sources of light vary in quality and it was a significant expense even for the richest.

Horse litters- they are rarely seen but they were main way of transportation for women, elderly and infirm. Travelling on horseback was trying, and wheeled vehicles were a pain due to poor roads and lack of amortisation.

When they know that things were diffrent but fail to gasp how

Other forms of transferring power than absolute primogenure- elections were a thing. Some kingdoms went back and forth between them and inheritance and even then kings tended to name and groom their heirs to avoid power struggle after their death.
 

Politically savvy princesses- either wallflowers or resentful tomboys. In real life wife of the leader wielded various amount of power and had means to extend it- by forming own court and diplomacy, money (in Poland they were given own domains to govern and support themselves) or religion. 

Religion - it was a part of real life to extent modern Anglo Saxon writers usually fail to understand but was present. How it was understood was a diffrent matter.

Related it the above- complicated laws with flexibility when it come to problems. Polish kingdom after century of fragmentation was united by king from so minor line that we didn't record his birth. The. there was almost half of the century when people weren't sure if the throne is to be elective or inherited and in the latter case- if they should support  young princelings or their older sister who thought her mother had some diluted blood of previous dynasty.

Yet,  none of it felt like it was ticking boxes for the sake of it, to me. It seems the world he builds in this series has a much  more pragmatic view on love and sexuality than our own current one.

Imagine there its a 6$ fee every time you entered some town and every time you crossed a county line, and when you crossed into a new dioceses. And that's if its just you walking to places. If you were god forbid trying to bring trade across boarders cause it will be a lot more than 6$. 

Speaking of random barriers and pre revolutionary France, good like trying to figure out what court you need sue or were going to be sued in. that could take years and huge amount of money even before the actual case started. There were three different court systems, which served different peoples, with over lapping boarders, non of which matched the then modern administration  boarders or physical boarders like mountains and rivers.

A flawed assumption, I know, but it's the one I subconsciously worked under.

It was Sanderson that broke me out of my assumptions. Jasnah Kholin; a prominent character in Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series. Despite subconsciously assuming Sanderson was an atheist, it was glaringly obvious that she wasn't written... Right. Despite what the story seemed to be shouting at me, she wasn't a critical thinker who had come to the standpoint of agnostic atheism. Rather, she seemed almost like a strawman; what a religious person _thinks_ an atheist is like. Despite Sanderson practically screaming at me that she was incredibly intelligent, all her arguments for her atheistic position were flawed at best. I thought to myself “these aren't the arguments of an atheist, they're the _misrepresentations_ of the arguments of an atheist. But why? Surely Sanderson's an atheist. Otherwise, he'd be a heretic. Why would he strawman his own position?""

After days of mulling it over, I looked it up and wasn't all that surprised. Granted, I don't think he's being deliberately preachy like Weeks may have been, otherwise he likely would have written Jasnah to be a much more contemptible or incompetent character, but what was clear is that he was trying to write a from a mindset that he didn't seem to quite understand.",Fantasy

* How much natural world there was in both variety and numbers. Tons of species other than the handful modern people come across and in vastly larger numbers in most cases.
* Food &amp; drinks are usually wrong or at best a very truncated version of reality. People generally eat &amp; drink the same limited meats &amp; beverages modern people consume. Every inn has beer and pork. They never have cowslip-flower wine to drink or eat auk meat.
* Disease and illness. Historical records are full of kings and queens suddenly dying from disease in their prime. It rarely happens even in the lore of a fantasy world.
* How hard travel actually was in most places and times. Characters never seem to have to stop and ask directions or spend three days traveling in the wrong direction or get a mere 20 miles from their hometown and not understand the local accent.

9601,"&gt;Poor agricultural technology leads to low urbanization (in 1100 Constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people) and career diversity (only 1 in 10 people weren't farmers)

1) Medieval agriculture was every bit as advanced as Roman agriculture and, especially from the 14th century onwards, considerably more so thanks to the widespread adoption of the three field system of crop rotation^1. Increased use of fertiliser and marling in areas with him population densities, as well as irrigation canals in parts of Italy and the Low Countries, also produced crop yields that were significantly higher than Roman era agriculture outside of Egypt (8-9:1 vs 4:1).

2) Urbanisation refers to the number of people who live in towns, not the size of mega-cities, and the middle ages stack up pretty well with the Roman Empire in this regard, at least within the bounds of that field of witcraft known as historical demography. Roman Italy, excluding Rome, probably had an urbanisation of 7-18%, depending on which population count you believe, although this might have been lower (3-8%, excluding Rome) if the rural population was [higher](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254434475_Cycles_and_Stability_Italian_Population_before_the_Demographic_Transition_225_BC_-_AD_1900) than traditional estimates allow. England, in 1086, had 10% of its population in towns and, by the early fourteenth, 15-20% of its population was urban. Italy has similar trends in urban densities, although 20-25% are likely to have been urban around 1300. While if you include Rome Roman Italy may have had a rate of urbanisation as high as 30% (18% for the population high count), Rome was an unusual case and not representative of the rest of the Empire.

3) As with all pre-modern agricultural societies, career density was low in Rome as with medieval Europe, perhaps even lower when you consider the slaves.

&gt;Small army sizes (usually ~10,000 max) and no standing army

Leaving aside Bernard and David Bachrach's arguments for the Early Middle Ages, armies in the High Middle Ages certainly exceeded 10 000 men with a high degree of frequency, as did armies in the Late Middle Ages, some of which exceeded 30 000 men in size. Since often the majority of these men were men-at-arms, with three or four horses each, the logistical impact was greater than a mostly infantry army of 60 000 men, making their use in the field an impressive feat of logistics.

&gt;Soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horses

Please no, not the ""levied peasants"" bullshit. Infantry in the High and Late Middle Ages were made up of prosperous free farmers or townsmen, who were ""levied"" in the same sense that Republican Roman infantry and medieval knights were levied. Also, they fight primarily with polearms and missile weapons, not swords.

&gt;Bizarre and confusing chains of command (one of the reasons the French lost at Agincourt was because the nobles couldn't decide who was in charge) with no soldier ranks

Sure, use Agincourt, where the problem was that the French army was made up of two factions who were at war with each other every other day and where there were plenty of ranks (Marshall, Master of the Crossbowmen, etc) and ignore the vintenars and centenars of England, the *vouden* and *vingtaines* of the Low Countries, the *venticinquina* and companies of Northern Italy, or the *conroi* used to organise knights, as well as all the many other battles where a clear chain of command existed (including, ironically, the English at Agincourt).

&gt;Little to no logistical support or organization

&gt;More advanced agricultural technology allows higher urbanization (at its height, Rome had between 50-90 million people) and career diversity (4 non-farmers out of 10 people)

1) The low count has 38.5 million people in Europe - excluding everything east of Greece, which is a fair chunk of Roman population - in 1000 AD and 73 million in 1346. This means the medieval world had, in 1000 AD, at least as many people as the Roman lowcount and in the 14th century probably equaled the Roman highcount. Unless you mean the city of Rome had 50-90 million people, in which case you're incredibly badly mistaken.

2) URBANISM DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. 

&gt;Massive standing armies (the British Isles alone had over 50,000 soldiers in 135 AD)

Which were spread out and field armies rarely exceeded those of medieval armies (10-20 000).

&gt;Career soldiers that build their entire professional lives around war

Medieval knights and mercenaries: am I a joke to you?

&gt;Highly standardized units and formations; military manuals discussing tactics and other aspects of war

Vegetius (and all his many medieval reworkers), Maurice, the Syrianus Magister, Leo VI, Nikephoros II Phokas, Nikephoros Ouranos and Theodore Palaiologos: are we jokes to you?

&gt;Clear chain of command with ranks and officers

My god, imagine how unclear the following chain of command is. King&gt;marshal/master of crossbowmen&gt;bannerets/constables&gt;knights/vintenars. Truly, it is an incredibly complicated and unclear chain of command.

&gt;Developed logistics with supply lines and corps of engineers, medical personnel, and other specialists

Which is why Edward III was always running into logistical problems, couldn't bridge rivers with ease, why knights didn't know how to treat a haemothorax. /s

Most ""medieval"" fantasy is Early Modern, anyway, so why bother with Rome instead of the late 15th/early 16th century?

^1 There was fairly slow adoption of this system, in spite of earlier scholarship seeing it as a rapid and revolutionary process, but by the fourteenth century it was more common than not.

9646,Yeah sorry. I think I expressed myself wrong. Cutting the wings off from wyverns made sense because they just turned to T. Rex and other theropods(?). I was thinking exclusively in terms of theropods and forgot all about sauropods. If you remove the wings of 6 limbed dragons they turn to sauropods for sure. But it threw me off because I was thinking about carnivorous dinos since most dragons have carnivorous looking heads if that makes sense,Fantasy
9647,"The Parasol Protectorate by Gail Carriger. First 2 books were great, then the nosedive began in the 3rd book and went full on crash and burn in the fifth. It's like Carriger was trying to churn them out as fast as possible and didn't care what the result was.",Fantasy
9648,"Yeah, I wouldn't say the OP is wrong exactly but I agree that the influences are more 19th century than Roman. In particular, virtually all fantasy - going back to Tolkien - has deeply developed nationalism that just doesn't really make sense before the 19th century.",Fantasy

9650,"So, yeah, I love Min, but I didn't love that these three women are all in love with Rand for no reason.  Like, they have no relationship with him in the early books. There's no bond. There's no warmth, no humor. They share nothing. He barely even interacts with any of them, ever. There exists, on the page, zero relationship between Rand and these other characters.

Min was a great character with a dimensional inner life.

Then we get a book where she's just, like, sitting on Rand's lap for an entire book?  Tickling him? Sexily pouting?

It was a shocking demotion of a well-realized, wonderful character, into a kind of no-agency giggleslut 

I was like wow, this is a truly terrible and problematic romance plot.

But then, in the next book, their relationship was suddenly completely different.  It hadn't developed on the page. But I'm not going to quibble about it, because the inexplicable changes were all positive. Now they _did_ have a relationship that was meaningful and discernible.

I wasn't going to criticize the path from awful to great. It had become something great. You just gotta embrace that. Somehow, it had morphed into something I could enjoy.",Fantasy

The high elven types--similar to humans but generally slender and more graceful--could have come from the transition the robust human phenotypes--*erectus* et al.--to the modern *gracile* phenotype.

9684,"&gt;(in 1100 Constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people)

Minor point, that was in Europe - the biggest cities at the time were Baghdad at around 500,000 and Chang'an which was around 1,000,000.  Also the Byzantine empire literally was Roman, although by that time period it was in severe decline.  

The other thing is that the massive armies of Rome were a deliberate strategy to move the ones likely to revolt into other places.  So the 50k or so in Britain were mostly auxiliaries from Spain and Germany, while British auxiliaries served in Spain and Africa.  That sort of strategy evolves from the need to manage a large empire, which is why it also crops up in the empires of the Middle East and China.  It doesn't work for small kingdoms, where the displaced forces can easily travel home if they want to.  

However the biggest problem with the Standard Fantasy Setting is that most readers have no idea what ""Medieval"" actually means, with film and books mashing together concepts that are hundreds of years apart.  
Compare and contrast for example at Kate Elliott's Crown of Swords series, which is firmly based on 800s early medieval with the spread of christianity and viking raids, and GRRM's Game of Thrones, which draws from the 1400s Wars of the Roses and the succession to Tudor rule.  Those are wildly different settings.",Fantasy

9686,"I think that's a quite limiting view of fantasy. Not every fantasy has a powerful magic user as the main character, heck not every fantasy book even has magic. Even when it does, more than often there's a heavy cost for the magic, and the problems with magic use often are the part of character arc.

See it in this way, even when you're a prodigy or super talented IRL you still have to practice to cultivate your skill, and even when you become really good at it, doesn't mean all your problems will go away. If anything it might attract a whole new set of problems like rivalry, sabotage, politics, sycophants, opportunists, etc.

However, for me the main reason I'm drawn to fantasy (and by extension speculative fiction) is the discourse of what ifs, what could be, and what the people would do, not necessarily just the character arcs.",Fantasy

9692,"Well there is a lot of speculative biology(I think that’s the right term) where people look at possible ways to recreate mythological creatures. I saw a post on Twitter the other day about some speculative version of the Hydra. It was achieved by coming up with an eel with adaptive scales that allowed them to hook to each other and created this “nest” of eel heads and thus a hydra.

A chupacabra could easily exist. If we look at the Mexican version, some sort of vampiric dog or large flightless bat would fit relatively easily into what a chupacabra is.",Fantasy
9693,"It doesn't feel like *a* bad ending to me, but a *wrong* ending for the setup that was done, if that makes sense?

Like, if I'd known in book 1 that this was how it ended, I wouldn't have been upset at the idea of what happened (except for having been spoiled, of course 😉). But with the setup that was done, it felt like the wrong threads were tugged dropped and the wrong threads used to wrap it up.

Like, the issue of &gt;!slavery and the evils of the chromeria!&lt; largely get dropped or glossed over, despite being huge parts of the setup. &gt;!the colour prince!&lt; just kinda gets forgotten and &gt;!all the immortals!&lt; become the centrepoint of the ending, despite barely being in the books.

Also while I don't mind the idea of &gt;!kip coming back to life!&lt; it just didn't do it for me. Both &gt;!his death!&lt;, which didn't feel that impactful to me, and his &gt;!resurrection!&lt;, which came out of nowhere and kinda felt unearned.

So anything that diminishes him as the focal point of the narrative is welcome. The thing in the series I find most interesting is the Aes Sedai power struggle and White Tower politics.

My sense is that, for most readers of this series, the opposite is true. They're bored by the White Tower stuff, and want to get back to the main storyline.

Also the romance storylines of those earlier books were.... rough. But the romance plot undergoes a major shift after book six (or maybe it was book five?) that made it a lot more tolerable for me.  Or, actually, maybe not just tolerable, but _good._",Fantasy

Of course nobody can know for sure, etc etc, but that there was at least something romantic there doesn't seem contrived to me.

Quality felt pretty consistent to me. But of course we all have different tastes.",Fantasy
9777,"If you're looking for a large series (warning: these require a lot of commitment to get through, although most fans of these will tell you the reward is worth it), would recommend adding the Wheel of Time, Memory Sorrow and Thorn, and the Malazan Book of the Fallen to that list, definitely core parts of the broader Fantasy universe in terms of what they've done / influences.

Alternatively, if you don't mind  standalones, would strongly recommend pretty much anything by Guy Gavriel Kay - most people start with one of Tigana, the Lions of Al Rassan or the Sarantine Mosaic, so pick the one whose blurb appeals to you the most as a starting point!

Other modern entries I'd recommend are the Goblin Emperor, the Rage of Dragons and the Powder Mage trilogy

Reading has... Well, not loving anything I'm currently reading. I've been chipping away at vandermeers dead Astronauts, it's just plain weird. Unfortunately nothing like borne, more like a writing experiment. Also reading Jane Yolens Midnight Circus, which is cute. I've dropped a crime novel a friend gifted me.

9785,"Also, I'd argue that warhammer fantasy in particular wins by playing into tropes.  Like, one of the big draws is that you can play as your favorite  fantasy trope.  It makes it easier to get started.  You don't have to learn about a completely new and unique setting -- instead, you can choose between medieval humans, 1600s humans, dwarves, a few variants of elves, orcs, beastmen, norse raiders, chaos warriors, and so on.  For the most part, anyone can hear a 5 second description of a faction and have a good idea of what they are about, which makes it easier for a new player to decide what to play.  

If you want to mix things up more with your setting, I think you probably need to hide some of that complexity from new players.  So, like, mass effect's setting doesn't rely on a bunch of existing tropes, but that doesn't matter that much, because the game starts you off with humans and you can learn about the rest of the setting as the game goes on.  Making a new player decide whether they wanted to play as turians, asari, quarians, salarians, or krogans right at the start of the game would be much more intimidating.",Fantasy

9803,"So I'm like half way through Malazan so take what I say with that in mind, but every engagement between magic powers has so far been a ""waves of power"" crashing into each other until one side loses, like if each of them actually did different shit with their magic that would be one thing, but literally all we see is people throwing ""power"" at each other, sometimes the power is ice, or fire, or darkness, but its never used creatively(except for illusion dude in the third? book), its just blasting each other. 

Also after the 3rd book I lost all hope in the Obfuscation of the mages as Quick Ben who was hyped up as being a literal god of magical ability was virtually useless in comparison to many of the other heavy hitters. Like dude blasts a necromancer with all his Warrens and the dude was fine, or during the seige he runs around doing not a whole lot, whereas if Rake or even Tayschren(Spelling? fire mage) were there I would expect them to just dumpster that army.",Fantasy

As far as in the books themselves, they are chock full of fantasy tropes from the time, each race has one or two very distinct traits and very little varies (example, if someone is Drasnian they are very sneaky and clever and probably either spying on you or swindling you out of money, if someone is a Cherek they are exceptionally strong and brave and dumb, if they are a Murgo they are an evil religious zealot, etc). If you’ve read and enjoyed other fantasy of the late 70’s and ‘80s (like Conan or Dragonlance) then it probably won’t bug you, but it lacks some of the nuance and complexity of modern book series.",Fantasy

Working in the Psychiatric field myself, I can say one of the single greatest indicators for aggressive and violent tendencies in adulthood is whether or not there was aggression and violence in childhood.

Is the level Jorg reaches a rarity? Yes. But it’s a fantasy. An intrinsic part of fantasy is that it involves an element of grandiosity—even if it’s in the background and indirect to the story, which in this case it isn’t—with its narrative and characters.

That said, there’s precedent in the real world for childhood trauma making monsters out of people that stack up to the monster that Jorg has become.

9945,It's relatively new! np.,Fantasy
9946,"I personally think the series lost all momentum when it swapped from Vaelin's POV to a multi-POV. Tried to do too much and went too fast. If you didn't mind the pacing and POV shift you might end up liking the series, I know some people did, but people's enjoyment of the series dropped after Blood Song.

I loved Vaelin as a character and the growth he had, I loved how the spacing was done with the ""future"" interludes (akin to KKC's) and the overall slow but steady pace and the thoughtful quality of the writing &amp; the sense of uncertainty and I felt like all those things mostly to completely vanished from the latter two installments.",Fantasy
9947,"Fans of Cornwell's *Warlord Chronicles* and *Saxon Stories*, or fans of the *Powder Mage* and *Shadow Campaigns* stories, should check out Cornwell's *Sharpe* books. They're THE Napoleonic land war adventure stories, which spawned an entire genre of imitators, none quite as good. 

I'd recommend starting with *Sharpe's Rifles*, which cuts right to the meat of the series with all the main characters, and is structurally similar to a lot of fantasy stories. Plus it's just really really good in general.",Fantasy
9948,Try The Tutorial is Too Hard. It's Korean with a decent(albeit slow) translation. The protagonist becomes ridiculously overpowered in later chapters.,Fantasy

9952,"I’m just giving him and others in the same situation the benefit of the doubt.  

It’s possible that he fully agrees with the governments policies, but with the very real possibility that his hands are tied it is unfair to blast him for it.

Especially when his book opens with a critical take on the Chinese cultural revolution.

I know plenty of people who live in democratic countries that still slurp up CCP propaganda and support their policies, so I generally agree with you.  Reddit insists all pro-China protestors are paid agents when they’re really just normal people most of the time.",Fantasy
9953,"I loved Their Bright Ascendancy - the demons were wonderfully horrifying, which worked really well.",Fantasy
9954,"We're all tacitly supporting all kinds of terrible things. Are we consistent about it though? 

I'm pretty sure some of your favourite movies, tv series and books that you've spent money on has problematic authors, actors, directors, etc. and you're just not informed enough to know. The products you buy every day likely has some dubious origins. Is there an onus on every consumer to educate himself about the opinions of all the cast, production, authors and companies? If no, so we're only boycotting artists/companies we happen to hear bad stuff about? Most people hold at least one or more non-PC views so what views do we shun and what do we ""tacitly support""? 

Boycotts rarely work. I don't think it's reasonable to expect average people to even care enough to boycott so many products/art. At the end of the day, you are just depriving yourself of so much good art and for what? There's no guarantee your boycott will lead to any meaningful change. And what are you left with? The other excellent art and the sub par art that wasn't good enough in the first place to occupy that spot in public consciousness. 

That is why I support separating the artist from the art although it's your choice what you buy. Just pointing out some considerations.",Fantasy
9955,"&gt;gang of four is probably just so generic its been used again and again in completely different contexts.

Gang of Four for instance in the US is the top ranking Republican and Democrat in both the house and Senate who is the upper level of the ""Gang of eight"" which is the 8 members (of both parties and of both houses) who are required to be notified for FISA warrants and some other stuff to do with the Patriot Act and domestic surveillance... So even there it's a similar usage but different concept.",Fantasy
9956,Yeah well it does not make his support for a genocide any better. He has to face the consequences in any case.,Fantasy

9958,The second was okay. The third was terrible.,Fantasy
9959,"Malazan is a commitment. It can be dizzying because the first 4 books are just setting up the rest of the series.  Then the fifth book comes along and you get sent to a different continent with completely new characters and a new society.  

Each book is excellent on its own, but because of these jumps lots of people quit on it.  Don’t do this.  

I’m wrapping up book nine now with book ten sitting on my nightstand.  It’s been hands down one of the best series I have ever read.  IMO Erikson is on the same level with Routhfuss, Sanderson, etc.  he’s truly a modern master.",Fantasy
9960,"Please, please tell me your joking.",Fantasy
9961,"There is short novel *Stonefather* by Orson Scott Card, which has magic  similar to elemental bending and I really liked it (and as you can guess by title earth bending may be included). It's also first work in *Mithermages universe,* which consists 3 full novels: *The Lost Gate,* *The Gate Thief* and *Gatefather*, so you will have something to follow up  if you like the first one.

On the other hand *Stonefather* is part of a rich antology [Wizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_(anthology)), where you can find various approaches to magic and perhaps you'll like some.",Fantasy
9962,Was reading the first book... time to put it in the fireplace :),Fantasy
9963,"Yeah, I kind of figured the book would at least tie itself to the problem in some way. I think part of the interest for me comes from a programming talk I watched a few months ago where the speaker was talking about ""template phrases."" (all your 'x' are belong to me, 'x' is the new 'y', keep calm and 'x' on, etc) His example was something about goto statements being bad and the origin of the concept. But since that talk, I've been noticing it a lot more in general phrasing, and it's become interesting to explore the origins or why they have ingratiated themselves into society.",Fantasy
9964,"This is a wonderful story with amazing artwork, and Minna's characters are so much fun.

The world is dark and grim, but not without hope and beauty.

There's horror in it, but also lots of humor and fun, too.

I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.

I've been reading it since 2014, I think, taking pauses and coming back to get caught up.

Always worth my time, and anyone just starting out has the full archive they can enjoy with no waiting.",Fantasy
9965,"This is a very western response. To most of us, it is absolutely mind boggling how anyone could think like this, but you are fooling yourself if you believe that the CCP doesn't have the approval of the majority of Chinese.

The simple truth is that the Chinese like the CCP. They view the role of the government differently. To a western person, most of us are naturally distrustful of those that have power over us, but in China, the government is seen as a benevolent parent. Why would a parent ever wish their children any harm?

To combat China, we need to start with understanding it. Thinking that Chinese people are just waiting for a revolution is childish and naive.",Fantasy

9973,"I've read the first two, and I think they are overall pretty critical of the CCP and human rights abuses. I don't think it's fair to judge him by this statement given that he lives in a society where there's not much else anyone can say besides the party line.",Fantasy
9974,Don’t listen to anyone who says Sanderson did a poor job. He did an amazing job.,Fantasy
9975,"I do not care. He stated the party line as expected. The same way US citizens defend their own concentration camps and rising fascism. Should we cancel every centrist democrat and republican author too?

Kameron Hurley's Bel Dame Apocrypha has bisexuals and bugs aplenty, on a world torn apart by greed. It goes dark at places, but never gratuitous.

9986,"Omg, you warned not to look at that sub and it's my own fault for looking. But holy hell. I do not want to know people like that exist. I stopped at the post of someone defending rape because you should be happy that they like you enough to want to do that to you....

I had a rough list of books... Emphasis on *had.* It's no surprise that I did not stick to it at all. XD

I don't think the card is too hard! As a beginner, I could think of a few books for each square off of the top of my head, and if I couldn't find one that interested me at the time, the community here is so nice and answered all of my questions. Needless to say, my TBR has multiplied!",Fantasy
9988,"Coming from a much more technical background, this thread is a bit of a mind fuck. To me, the three body problem is a physics problem. I didn't even know there was a science fiction book by that name. Likewise, gang of four is a set of design patterns for software.

Point is, it's kind of interesting how certain, very specific phrases can have such vastly different meanings based on the background or context of a discussion.",Fantasy
