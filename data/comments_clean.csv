5,a lot of people like it because it's good.,1
6,"book or show? i haven't seen the show, but the book was extremely disappointing.",1
7,"yeah, when people insist on comparing the two it seems like a borderline “well to be fair you have to have a high iq” statement; they’re both very good for the very separate things they are. one thing i absolutely do agree on though is that people truly need to get over subtitles. i see assholes on r/movies talk down on netflix all the time as if netflix’s american output is all there is. that platform is fostering straight-up amazing content overseas.",1

15,i’ve always shied away from captioning because i found it distracting. but lately my wife cannot hear very well so she started using captioning. i don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. subtitles are my friend now. i watch almost nothing without them.,1
16,"it's a fantastic show, would highly recommend checking it out. watch it in german if at all possible.",1
17,"there are some superficial similarities to stranger things, particularly in the first seasons of both shows.",1
18,"the first one is probably better. i find the second movie is more entertaining, but it compromised on quality. i did not notice this myself, wife pointed it out, but the sound design in 2 is ridiculous. straight out of looney tunes. there was a tonal shift for sure. seems to happen a lot; you take this movie which had a great idea, sequel is easy money but if you just tweak it a little, round off the edges, you could hit a wider audience. i miss the edges.",1

49,"i love this show, it is so good and the music and sound direction is absolutely fantastic",1
50,agree. i also really like that it's a legit view into how another culture functions without that being the focus of the show. the difference in the relationship between teenagers and their parents is especially striking.,1
52,"it may not be indicative of the highest caliber but i don’t think it should be called a “low bar” for writing, at least not insofar as low bar is an insulting term. show, not tell, is easier said than done. i think most writers struggle with it and only a few are truly excellent. there is a lot of enjoyable fiction out there that may not make the “excellent” class but shouldn’t be insulted for it. also, noticing good points of storytelling technique is not necessarily indicative of a sad state of tv writing. a lot of people who appreciate good storytelling and who come to talk about these things online are “trained” to notice what maybe most viewers don’t. i’ve noticed a lot of people online can identify these things. i actually spent time in basic story classes that pointed out these techniques. just because i can point it out doesn’t mean that they did it poorly.i say this while agreeing with you about the state of tv and film writing in general. for me though, it seems more like a lot scripts fee more like “first drafts” that just went straight to filming. :/  this show isn’t the best of sci-fi or tv, but it certainly wasn’t that for me either.",1

69,"it actually poses some sf questions, but if you don't like the humor it's not really worth it.",1
70,"the technology has had over a decade to progress in this universe so it's entirely possible they've merged it with some more sensors, web cam, user profiling and ml to approximate the avatars reactions/behaviours. i agree some of the things are pretty far fetched but keeping in mind this in the mid-2030s and allowing for technologies to mature help with the suspension of disbelief.i find their cell phone tech much more far fetched, having what seems like embedded projectors and sensors in their fingers somehow giving nearly opaque high def video and wireless communication abilities with ""touch"" sensors. perhaps this tech allows for some limited interactions in vr as well.",1
71,"there are many, many, things wrong with the series, but these two are not that bad: they can digitize a human consciousness, but people still use vr glasses to interact well, the digitization process is destructive, one-way, and will nullify all your human rights. still want to do it? vr / full immersion is a valid interaction mechanic given the maluses of the scanning process. they have completely perfect, accident-free self driving cars, but require low paid workers for tech support?keep in mind this is for lakeview, a posh, high-end environment for millionaires and billionaires. it's the difference between picking up the phone in a hotel and saying ""wake me up at 7 in the morning"" vs fiddling with the alarm mode on the same phone. some people need their butlers. and the ai is shown to not be  completely up to the task...some of my criticisms: these cs reps have waaay too much time on their hands. you could argue that the subjective angel latency is a trackable metric, but still... who in their right mind puts a suicide jump point in the system, in the simulation itself, in a place that is accessible to avatars? i mean, each person jumping off is a potentially infinite loss to the company. nobody uses these really awesome ar/vr systems to telecommute? latency's not an issue, apparently, as you can join from seedy little corner shops from locales with single-digit dollar-per-square-foot locales. i don't believe any billionaire worth the name would consent to such an existence without having a mongol army of lawyers making sure he still has his rights after the upload, security of mind and privacy being the major ones. best way to do this? make them law, which would apply for everyone. there are no buttons for 30 minute orgasms? dude, you have the whole brain in emulation, and sex is shown to work. no guilt-free psychedelic trips? no brain overclocks?  no furries? maybe it's just the conservative lakeview, but these are the folks with both means and motive to engage in kinky shit. likewise, no ai call girls? they don't need to do much...anyway, i could go on and on... i liked the show, but it suffers from the star trek technology of the week syndrome: tech is introduced but is never fully explored.",1
72,"david weber has a couple of series.  honor harrington is his military sci-fi series, and the so called ""honorverse"" is around 25 novels in the main series with quite a few spin-offs.   he also has a series called safehold which has the basic concept of humanity hiding from a superior race trying to kill them by reverting their technology to middle age-era.  that one is very interesting also, but suffer the same flaw as honor harrington: later books spent a lot of time setting up the world but the plot doesn't move forward much.  but that series details technology that already exists in great detail, so it's interesting for that.   another common theme of david weber (author of both) is that he is a history buff. a lot of characters are based off real life historical figures.  sometimes he even makes puns off the name, for instance a major villain is named ""rob s. pierre"", which is a pretty obvious pun off a certain french dude.",1
73,the characters being so shallow ruined it for me,1
74,wool by hugh howey.everyone lives in a tremendous underground silo and has been for generations.  no one knows how or why they are there and asking questions as to why is forbidden and will get you sent in on a one way trip outside where you will use steel wool (thus the series name) to clean the lenses on the cameras outside that show the apocalyptic landscape that will poison and kill you within minutes.,1
75,one of the better sci-fi shows ever in my opinion. it should get far more attention than stranger things. i know the german doesn’t help though.,1
76,"diaspora and permutation city are my favorites but if you're into physics, i guess dichronauts or orthogonal are probably more interesting. quarantine also has a great premise. he also has many short stories online free to read (closer is my favorite short), check them out to see if you like his style. the first chapter of diaspora is also on his web site and it's mindblowingly fantastic. enjoy :)",1
77,"the production values are amazing, but there was a bit too much cheese. then again, i've never been into sitcoms. ymmv",1

81,"yes but with just an occulus, there is no input device to show them smiling, walking, laughing or even sleeping.  somehow the headset is able to detect all those things and input it into the system to represent them.that's a big problem with today's games.  you can go into a vr game, but your avatar is just going to be a big lump.  ever try to tell your pc to have your avatar shake someone's hand?  quick, what key combo is that?",1

85,god this show is absolutely one of the most underrated. the crazy things nearly every episode. just can’t wait.,1

95,"there's a lot of sci fi out there for you to read...along the lines of vorkosigan and old man's war, try elizabeth bear's vatta's war or the serrano legacy.for exploration with humor, look at the bobiverse books by dennis e taylor.also humorous are martha wells' murderbot books, starting with all systems redfor that cyberpunk feel, try altered carbon by richard morgan.also highly recommended are becky chambers (a long way to a small angry planet) and ann leckie (ancillary justice)",1
96,"clouds are formed when water condenses around tiny particles suspended in the air. as long as air circulates in the atmosphere and there are condensation nuclei and some water vapor in it, clouds will form regardless of the force of gravity. on earth, different types of clouds form at different altitudes depending on the density and temperature of air. in a planet with a stronger gravity, the atmosphere will be compressed, so maybe clouds will tend to form at lower altitudes. if the winds are strong they might be able to carry moisture up to the highest reaches of the atmosphere so that the clouds will form there.there are clouds on jupiter. clouds have been hypothesized on gigantic exoplanets. if there is a circulating fluid and drops of other fluid can be suspended in it, there will be clouds.",1
97,"i see what you're saying but i feel like they did it purposefully.  they wanted to stick closely to the comedy aspect of the show, and asking those questions to forcefully would have them laying it on thick.  they allow the viewer to ask the questions.if they asked it to forcefully the show would become some long-form version of an episodic moral quandary series like the good place, and that shit is just cringey to me.",1
98,"i have found it really enjoyable. it isn’t a charlie stross or greg egan take on transhumanism but the characters are multi-dimensional, engaging, and sympathetic. the principles acting is good, too. looking forward to season 2.",1

106,"no, it doesn't work, because it's a romantic comedy for hipsters so they have no time to explore that interesting sci-fi background.is there an effort to claim legal rights for virtualised people? no idea, because it wouldn't advance the bloody romcom story...",1
107,"i didn't know what to expect going in and i was pleasantly surprised by the characters, the story, the satire, the genre blending ... then i realized it came from the same ep as the office and parks and rec.",1
108,"yeah, i see where you're coming from. i just couldn't root for the protagonists, so not my fav kind of show.",1
109,"i find upload to be a very mediocre offering.  it has three main issues:1. the class-warfare political message is as oppressive as it is boring.  i am so sick and tired of the bad guy being some big bad corporation motivated by greed.  it doesn't matter if you think that is the shape of the world or not (it isn't)... at this point it's beyond cliche, beyond predictable... every second talking about the class divide between those who can upload and those who can't afford to is a waste of the viewer's time... upload in this world is a service... just like every other service it will cost money!  that shouldn't even have to be specified, it can be assumed that any viewer would be able to figure that out on their own the same way that they know that all clothes and food used by the characters is paid for... a defacto class divide between some uploads and other uploads, or those who can afford to upload and those who can't, might be diverting enough to be a minor theme in one episode, but it certainly does not support being belaboured to the point of being an entire multi-episode spanning plot!  it's like adding characters and a plot to a basic high school class on economics, and then calling it 'injustice' that 2+2=4 despite the fact that it would be convenient for it to equal 7.2. the story does not take advantage of it's science fiction nature or themes.  it doesn't push the envelope of what could be done with a story with both virtual and non virtual characters.  if you wanted to play the class-warfare card then, there are way better ways to do it that the dumb portrayal of the 2gigs in upload... you could have different run-speeds like the slow clubs in permutation city.  or if you want to say that complex thought somehow costs more, then have the 2gigs shift suddenly, and with no intermediate, between emotional states... they are happy, or sad, or angry, but complex emotions like frustration, envy, melancholy are costly to simulate so they oscillate between emotional primary colors.  similarly, there are no copies of uploaded people... you would think that backup copies, to say nothing of multiple instances of the same person running simultaneously would be a not just a thing, but a great way to explore stories that weren't just more of the narrative same.  it would be awesome to see the girlfriend character just rebooting her boyfriend after a social gaff from a state before it happened, or trying 15 different versions of the same conversation until she found one that worked the way she wanted.  one of the main story lines involves a love triangle between an upload and two flesh and blood women... well why can't they both have a copy of him?  the complete lack of willingness to explore what would make uploaded people different from normal people makes the story rather bland.  we see people altering the physical appearance of the upload's avatars... and hear about features such as double jointed hips being added... but where are the mental modifications?  wouldn't it be interesting to include a capacity for an upload to turn on or off his sex drive?  or make himself smarter?  or add skills and knowledge with the press of a virtual button?  these and a dozen other obvious opportunities for really exploring a very different state of being are completely ignored.3. the characters are very strangely written.  they go from being shallow to the point of not even being 2 dimensional to being deep and insightful on the drop of a hat.  one moment they are callous and dismissive, and the next considerate and sacrificing.  sex is just dropped in with no point or purpose as if the authors had a tawdry check-list of sexual themes that must be met each episode.  i don't have a problem with sex in a story, but it should serve a function beyond window dressing about the hook-up culture of the future.  just everything about how the story is written is inconsistent.",1
110,"honor harrington goes very very in-depth on how all the different weapons and other ship systems work. the ship battles are mostly tactical overviews “the first manticore volley fired 1,254 missiles, 538 got intercepted, 300 detonated against the wedges, and the rest killed x number of ships” sort of thinghe also goes very in depth with the politics in the universe. in fact, these issues are a problem in the later novels, as the plot slows down to a crawl and most of the novels are simply fleshing out even more politics and stuff",1
111,"while not strictly what you requested, expeditionary force is a bit of a different spin on the request.  i enjoyed the first book and several others into the franchise on audiobook.this is the link to the first book on amazon   is the link to the series on audible:  ",1
112,"the way i described it to my mate was ""imagine devs meets the good place"" and honestly i'm pretty chuffed with the comparison.",1
113,"100% agree. i thought it was unfunny and boring. almost none of the gags landed for me and the sci-fi elements were mainly just low stakes foils for the protagonist that weren't explored in any meaningful way.also, the characters were very flat and i could not bring myself to care about any of the consequences they faced. all in all, kind of shit imo.",1
114,"it's surprisingly much better then expected, especially compared to the trailer, i was worried that it would be too sitcom and over the top but it's actually quite genuine and well acted.it's a male-friendly romantic comedy, obviously don't expect huge metaphysical or philosophical revelations about technology, it's not black mirror.",1
115,"i watched the first episode and decided not to continue. it billed itself as sci fi comedy, but it's actually pretty light on any of the key questions that would make it good sci fi. it's also not funny enough to be a good comedy (imho). i was not a fan.i'm actually really surprised to see so many enjoyed it as mush as they did. maybe i didn't set my expectations  appropriately.",1
116,"yeap. the vr was definitely used merely as a plot device with little thought to how it'd actually work (nora appears to be able to see rl, vr and what's on her computer screen all at once at points...) but in terms of what a corporation would get up to in terms of ""in app"" purchases etc.? yeah they've got that right.",1
117,"i thought the show was pretty good. it wasn't really funny to me at all, it was more like a typical love story wrapped in very light scifi. they didn't use the virtual world in an exciting way and most of the time the interactions would have been no different if they had taken place in actual reality.",1

121,"when i worked at burger king, we kind of had the opposite problem: during the lunch and dinner rushes, meat was going straight from the broiler/deep fryer to the prep table and during the downtime, we had way too much storage space. we had several of these cubbyhole-style food warmers( that could store product for an hour or two, and each one could hold an entire broilerful/basketful of meat. on an average day, we could easily use a few to store breakfast meats and eggs.",1
122,"umm, everyone has their own opinions about everything. i really liked the movie, plus it is in my list of favorite psychological drama movies. you watched it for the wrong purpose, it is not some science movie. plus, i have recommended to my friends who admire good movies, and they liked it too. everyone has different tastes and choices and that's okay.",1

135,"yeah, i took the show more for a comment on corporations controlling everything than an accurate representation of virtual reality.",1
136,"yeah, that makes sense.  however i think it would add depth to this universe if those things were part of the story and not just viewer speculation.  in other words, i think the plot is far too ""live person vs. virtual person romance""-driven and they are leaving some really interesting ethical questions unanswered.  for example, another one is that !nora is supposedly falling for nathan but doesn't seem to have a problem with the fact that she can shut him down whenever she wants, take away his agency in looks and in movement, and the show plays it for laughs with no concerns at all.!< i hope they address some of them in upcoming episodes.",1
137,"i’m about halfway through and i’m pretty mixed on it. the concepts and plot are keeping me going, but i think the big downside is that none of the actors are really comedic. so there are all of these jokes but they all land flat. the amateur detective lady seems like the only person in the cast who has any sense of timing.",1

149,"i agree.  the upload virtual world is just so mundane and boring.  there's no sense of wonder at all, apart from free food that disappears after 'eating hours' for no reason at all. also there are no discussions of the ethical concerns around playing god for a bunch of disembodied but self-aware entities.  the upload entities seem to have no rights at all, and underpaid it workers basically have life and death power over them.  obviously you can ignore this stuff, but it's almost impossible in a world where black mirror has already explored some of these issues.   that said, i did enjoy it if i ignored these questions, and i'm looking forward to season 2.",1

(doesn't help that they lost the original models so textures look all muddy now.) but additionally, some of the acting on b5 is... iffy. as much as i loved them back in the day, sheridan and ivanova are rough to watch in spots. it was a very uneven ride.still love b5, but it's showing its age way more than ds9.",1

star trek has never been regressive at the time and has occasionally pushed the envelope. but it's pushed the envelope relative to present-day america, not relative to anything realistically futuristic.in terms of social dynamics we're way past even ds9 in dealing with these issues already. not very futuristic if they consistently fail to extrapolate even a couple of decades.that's fine. they do more good by serving as mirrors to present day issues than presenting something that genuinely try to guess and extrapolate further into something people would have problems identifying with. they couldn't pull off to integrate ferengis as a honest and straight up different race. they were mostly handled like idiots by other races, especially by klingons and humans. the way the officers dealt with quark was awful and sometimes downright criminal.we'd only seen a handful of ferengis at that point. the view of the ferengis was shaped by stereotyping the handful shown. the ferengi as they were existed as a species only because that assumed extrapolation was the inherent expectation of star trek at the time.if it had not been, then nobody would have had an issue with suddenly seeing ferengi's show up that are all different. but the federation despite its high and mighty ideals, is in that incarnation full of racists who systematically talk about whole species of people as if they can be reduced to a stereotype of that species.you can't change that overnight without totally changing the society around them to a point where it would no longer be recognisable star trek.dragging trek forwards meant actually starting to show the stereotypes fail step by step by showing the characters themselves come to the realization that the ferengi (and others) do not neatly fit the stereotypes.at the same time it's clear the ferenegi does have a deeply regressive culture, so some of the treatment where the treatment is about their culture is justified. but they're also given multiple arcs to show that individuals can transcend that culture and in turn start to change it, which knocks on its head the foundation of the early use of stereotypes in star trek as a ""shortcut"" to define characters. a lot of the character arcs in ds9 in fact focuses on showing how you can not assume someones character based on their species/race. previously we had e.g. spock and worf presented as the ""stranger in a strange land"" characters who struggle with their identity, and where as such their actions in contradiction of stereotype is treated as part of that conflict, and as such they're ""exceptions"". this view of the ""exception"" that has been ""tamed"" and taught our culture is in itself a deeply racist trope to many by modern standards. i have deeply racist white neighbours with black friends. their black friends are all ""exceptions"" that as exceptions can not invalidate my neighbours racist stereotypes of black people because they're not ""like those others"" as they've told me more than once.in ds9 instead we see characters that are unapologetically sure of their identity as part of their species but still acts in ways that contradicts the stereotype without some nod to being half human or brought up by humans etc. to make them exceptions.that's the biggest legacy that ds9 left trek with: you can no longer see any of these species and safely assume they'll act according to a stereotype unless they wear a star fleet uniform and have been ""tamed"".",1

214,"ds9 was made darker in some respect, but their treatment of racism was not it. on the contrary, if there's anything to fault it for in that respect it is that it does not go anywhere near the kind of darkness and lasting conflict real racism involves. ben sisko does some soul searching and accepts nog. miles does some soul searching and grudgingly learns to accept cardassians. sisko has issues with vic fontaine's whitewashing of history with its racism-free vegas one moment, but accepts stereotyping by species in ops the next moment (and throughout the series). and so on. racism in ds9 is to be shrugged off and put aside, and everyone decides to live together happily ever after.their treatment of war was much darker, though that too sanitized it to an extreme extent. ds9 is an extremely idealized version of a somewhat more realistic future, and that makes it seem darker at times. but it's still idealized.i also don't buy that it's all that much darker. tos has federation official turn a planet into nazis and prepare for genocide as a way to illustrate the need for non-interference, for example. it seems light hearted in large part down to the exchanges on the bridge - often full of racism - that downplay the misery they keep running into, and because the episodic format meant they always saved the day in the end to not leave things unresolved.but they go from crisis after crisis showing us a universe full of war, slavery and oppression, and showing us that intervention often makes things worse or achieves nothing.it's ""light"" with a childs eye that ignores the underlying misery. i wish i could see it that way.ds9 to me is much more positive - it shows a society that is transforming and growing and learning. cardassia goes from an oppressive dictatorship to civilian rule. bajor comes out from under their foot and reasserts itself. the founders are beaten and taught a lesson. the ferengis are on course to reform their whole society. large parts of the alpha quadrant manages to come together and set aside their differences and cooperate. the story liftes two entire quadrants of the galaxy significantly up. there's dark moments, but they serve to punctuate a story that for the most part represents a massive upwards trajectory.",1

222,"holy... bowl of heaven and eon sound amazing ! thank you so much! (i already read ringworld back when i was into dyson spheres, quite an amazing structure as well. i was less thrilled about the characters though.)",1
223,"agreed on all points, really.",1
224,"maybe pushing ice by alastair reynolds, a fair chunk of the book is the characters trying to survive on an alien ship that transports them to a larger alien structure.",1

226,perfect. thank you!,1
227,"ok that's the third time i stumble upon the three body problem, i'm getting it !",1
228,"heart of gold, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.",1
229,"it's a fairly narrow genre. instead of looking for an audiobook, just look for books which meet your criteria, then see if audiobooks exist.for example...ringworld audiobook :  audiobook:  of heaven audiobook: ",1
230,"i'd highly recommend ""remembrance of earth's past."" it's a 3 part book series, and only a 1/3 of the story is about exploring a spaceship/structure, but it's very good and thrilling.plus ex-president obama endorsed it! :d from wikipedia: obama described the book as having ""immense"" scope, and felt that it was ""fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with congress seem fairly petty"".22",1

234,i thought that the loop worked quite like eureka too. but more final.,1
235,"i suppose so :-)but it probably depends on the setting.in this case, the stories in wh40k are set in ""our"" far future, which more or less plops it into ""proper"" science fiction.but at the same time, similar to star wars and barbarella, they don't really make much of an attempt to describe how all of the sciency stuff is sort of supposed to work, in principle; apart from vague hand-waving about superb gene-engineering and machine spirits.i always thought of space opera as being closer to fantasy, in space, than science fiction that's halfway plausible. i.e. the story and adventure are much more important than how this servitor's is screaming silently inside his skull for centuries because the techpriest failed to invoke the litany of the empty mind during the servitorization process :-)also, everything must be colossal. the bigger the better. especially if it explodes.it's also vitally important for the characers' pauldrons and starched collars to occlude their peripheral vision.on the other hand, wh40k handles ""magic"" quite nicely, by making it a manifestion of a different strata of reality, i.e. the warp and its infinite energy being chanelled through some poor bastard's burning eyeballs; instead of simply being benign magic that doesn't try to kill the user that often. even the ""gods"" are simply colossal aliens, of a sort.there's nothing wrong with space opera, it's fun :-)",1

237,"i'm currently about halfway through my first watch through of voyager and i don't completely hate it and think it does have some solid episodes here and there, but so far it's easily been my least favorite trek show of the ones i've seen so far (tos, tng, and ds9). besides the overreliance on technobable to save the day at the end of almost every episode instead of just being a tool to move the plot along, most of the characters are kind of flat and i find myself not being all that invested in any of them most of the time. ds9 handled all of that so much better while also forging a unique identity for itself that wasn't just ""a lesser tng""",1
238,"on the other hand, people who worked on the show have said that they got away with a lot more on ds9 because berman and his cabal were focused on voyager as the flagship show that was going to replicate the bankable tng formula.",1

248,"the worst part is that nostalgia holds back everything. nostalgia sells, new ideas and better writing don't. you need to borrow from other movies/shows to get the audience on board, give them something too alien like annihilation and they're gonna get bored or frustrated.you still need to use a popular ip as a cover to slide avant garde concepts, like with bsg and westworld.",1
249,i've read an interview with andy robinson and he says that's how he's playing the character until a few episodes in the studio told him to stop playing the character as attracted to bashir.,1
250,"perhaps the sci-fi concepts left to explore are way too taboo or too intellectual to generate a massive audience/interest. perhaps some are too close to home to even call them sci-fi anymore, even if they were prescient 20 years ago.a.i had good concepts, but i still imagine kubrick giving us something completely different than spielberg.you also need to realize that we have pop scifi vs real scifi. those superheroes/transformers/alien movies instead of bringing audiences to more hard sci-fi, end up generating more demand for pop sci-fi.the sci-fi genre es getting gentrified and chewed slowly by other genres, just like it happened with cyberpunk. instead of showing our world through other worlds, is giving us a piñata parody of the future.",1

254,yeah.... but ds9 was well-written and well-acted.........babylon 5:jms couldn’t write anything resembling a professional script with anything close to decent dialogue.and most of his cast were god-awful actors—jeff conawayclaudia christianjerry doylestephen furstbill mumymira furlan ouch — you couldn’t pull together a worse cast for a tv show if you tried.,1

261,"no? have you watched ds9? it's as idealistic as any of the other treks. shit, how many racists do you know that actually change their views when presented with counter evidence instead of ""well theyre one of the good ones!"". ds9 characters actually growing in their views is more idealistic than original trek that basically worked off the assumption that some races (klingons) were just too different to ever coexist.",1

263,"ds9 was my favorite star trek. the story kept building up... i have a lot of friends who never like it because the story was so big, so broad... it had everything, but now that i think about it - it could have been better with a few visits from q. i don't remember if he ever showed up or not.",1

284,"i know people who don't like ds9 are getting downvoted in here, but i will add my two cents. the characters overall were well made i felt, but it is interesting to me that ds9 is praised for long story/archs, when the main story about the bajor religion and sisko being the emissary is terrible, gradually decending into lord of the rings type fantasy and even ripping off the lord of the rings payoff in the last episode.the dominion war stuff was interesting i would say and there is some well made stuff in between, but there was a lot thing i couldn't stomach in this series.",1

372,"the transformation of the ferengi is notably one of the most obvious ways in which ds9 was the first trek that openly addressed racism in the federation instead of as ""look at that backwards racist culture; we'd never do that"" of tos.tos openly used racial stereotypes to address racism one moment, while having e.g. mccoy constantly using racial jibes against spock, for example (not to mention the ethnic makeup of the crew etc.). tng and voyager got marginally better.but ds9 goes all in from early on: sisko was confronted about his racist stereotyping of nog when jake first befriends him for example.but the ferengi definitively benefited from that choices to actually try to reduce the treatment of the other species to racial stereotypes most of all, with nog showing they can succeed in star fleet, rom going from stereotypical ferengi chauvinist to accepting females as equal and standing up from workers rights, moogie showing ferengi women as strong and capable, and even quark showing a sympathetic side on a semi-regular occasion.it was basically the first trek that effectively openly admitted to be a mirror of contemporary american society rather than to striving to actually depict the future, and as such they could admit to there being racism and stereotyping and address them explicitly by having recurring characters - including benjamin and miles - struggle with their own views, instead of trying to pretend the federation itself was pure, which had become increasingly untenable.",1

394,"well i mean back then we didn't know the level of bashir's genius so in comparison you are right, and yes they had a friendship but not in the same way he did with o'brian. like no comparison. not dismissing what you said, they had a unique dynamic to be sure.",1

401,tony todd is so awesome.  one of the highest rated episodes of ds9 is the visitor where tony todd plays an elderly jake sisko in the future.,1
402,garak might have been playing chess but bashir was definitely playing tic tac toe lol. idk could be i'm remembering the early seasons better than the later ones so the garak-bashir interactions are much more memorable to me.( in my memory it's always two of them having lunch :p,1
403,"yes. i was raised in a cult. my books taught me how to think, and the people i met because of them became some of the ones who helped me escape.i owe everything to sci-fi and fantasy.",1
404,"hey man, the enterprise ones were kinda fun. the ds9 ones can kick rocks, though",1
405,truth annoys the trumptards and apparently these fanbois :dit's my favourite star trek because they ripped off an amazing idea and b5 has them beat hands down in execution. ah well.,1
406,no bashir and garak are those dudes you see playing chess in the park out of respect for the game. bashir and o'brian became brothers.,1
407,all these comments and no love for garak! my favorite spy.,1

409,hahah so true,1
410,babylon 5 was a different animal. similar true but a very well done show.,1
411,"maybe that’s the trick. just skip the bad ones. i’ve always had a mental block against doing that for some reason. like the main reason i never rewatch buffy the vampire slayer is that so much of the first season was absolutely awful (can we say internet demon?) but overall i have great memories of the show as a whole. i wonder if there’s a guide out there of which episodes are best left un-rediscovered, and which are too good to miss.",1
412,"berman may have stolen straczynski’s premise, but once you scratch the surface, the two shows are vastly different. the dominion war played out very differently from the shadow war...",1

415,"i found it was like that the whole way through, plus i couldn’t sympathize with any of the characters or find them interesting. i tried, i watched it to the end (skipping a lot of episodes in later seasons just to get through the main story arc faster), but if you don’t like it you don’t like it.",1
416,"i'm rewatching them all during the lockdown and i feel that the first two seasons of tng are hard to digest as they do seem dated.  with the remaster, however, seasons three and on hold up really well.  the first two seasons felt like tos and the production quality (sets, uniforms, camera angles) just felt cheesy.  there are some required episodes in those seasons (measure of a man, for example), but i just skipped most other episodes.",1
417,now you know which character wets panties faster.,1
418,"the first time i watched it, i started on season 7.  by the time i finished that, i was so curious how they got there, i went back and watched season 6.  that left so many mysteries i went back and watched season 5, and so forth.  i think when i hit season 2 i finally lost interest.  i eventually went back and watched the whole thing in the correct order, but i've never enjoyed it as much as that first time watching the seasons backwards.i'd say it's safe to just skip seasons 1 and 2 completely.  season 3 is just starting to get interesting, but it picks up more and more steam as it goes along.",1
419,it just annoys me that ds9 is a copy so many of its storylines are directly taken from b5. here is a good thread about all of it.  ,1
420,"most focus on characters, relationships and dialogues in the entire st universe.",1
421,hes cool but i like worfs brother kurn. whom i met outside a strip club once. i was asking him about ds9 when a girl walked by and yelled 'candyman!' at him.. lol,1
422,"b5 was good overall but the first season is a struggle.  i could never get behind the first commander on that show as his acting was just way over the top.  once they brought tron in as his replacement it got really good.  the last season kind of sputtered out, but if i recall correctly, that was because there was uncertainty with renewing the show which forced the writers into a corner that was just too hard to get out of.",1
423,god i heard that in rom's voice,1
424,"when the defiant shows up in season 3 the show gets better.  they tried to make up for the lack of a starship early on by having the larger runabouts instead of shuttlecraft, but it was hard to make them appear capable against pretty much anything else.  the defiant was a legitimate warship which really allowed ds9 to project some influence.  early on the show also feels pretty standard to the trek formula.  episodes were standalone with the continuity being somewhat rare and confined to more of a background role.  in my opinion, when the dominion shows up and starts a war the show went from good to incredible and is also when the long-form continuity started to express itself.  there was a storyline at the beginning of a season (5 or 6? can't remember precisely) that was essentially a 6 or 7 episode mini-series following a military campaign with sisko as one of the chief strategists.  it was an incredible story arc that had several epic space battles and was unlike anything a star trek had ever done.the show just took a bit to find its groove, but once it did everything changes.  push through the first two seasons and you will be rewarded.also, give enterprise a shot.  season one was very standard trek and wasn't bad.  granted, season two was unfortunately some of the worst content in the st franchise and felt cliche and unoriginal, but gets better.  season 3 was, imho, was absolutely grand with some serious long-form continuity following a year long mission in the xindi expanse.  it set the stage for many future star trek tropes and concepts.  the final season is when the show really found its legs with a solid compromise with serialization.  they did several 2 to 3 episode arcs that let them tell traditional trek storylines but with enough time to really flesh out the ideas.enterprise is a controversial show for a lot of trekkies, but personally i really liked most of it.",1
425,"i’m about to finish my fourth rewatch of ds9, with no desire to rewatch tng, oddly. whenever i see how dated next gen always seems, it pulls me out of the story. i think for me anyways, it’s because those characters never went away. i loved watching picard, for example, but it just highlights that that story, and those characters have continued to evolve and expand, whereas the old stories seem so limited in retrospect. and it’s not just ds9, i’ve been through voyager several times, and even enterprise more than twice. don’t get me wrong, i loved tng back in the day. and i still love those characters and those actors. but (like tos) it’s just not held up to rewatchability for me.",1
426,"no idea if this is even remotely helpful, but i am currently re-watching deep space nine and probably would have stopped by now if not for the companion podcast i'm listening to after each ep. it's called the greatest generation. it's couple of star trek fans good-naturedly nsfw poking fun at every episode. one of the things i really like about it is that they both have a background in film and videography, so their commentary is also a bit of a learning experience. again, not sure if that is your cup of tea, just thought i'd mention it in case it sounds like an interesting way to get through ds9.",1

431,"when worf joins the cast, season 3 i think.",1
432,i was more into tng but the character arcs of ds9 were more in depth and solid. i liked jake sisko as a character and as a single father the finale had real resonance with me.,1
433,"it's probably the most divisive star trek. there's a large enough minority that feels it's their favorite (i'm in that group) that it makes for a lot of fun arguments. i see us as the george harrison fans of star trek. it's not a small enough minority that making it a favorite is seen as just being ironic or weird like the voyager or enterprise crowd, like having ringo as your favorite beatle.",1
434,mine too.it's a big part of why it worked. being stuck in one place meant that the story had to come to them which made for a much better opportunity to develop an ongoing story. all the races they interacted with were able to be better fleshed out because the setting of being in one space station that never went anywhere demanded it.,1
435,i don't like it cause its a blatant babylon 5 ripoff,1
436,i watched babylon 5 before ds9 and its such a damned ripoff. if you like ds9 go watch babylon 5 its the original. ds9 was made after the studio rejected babylon 5 and when it started doing well they made babylon 5 with a star trek skin(ds9). there was even a lawsuit about it.,1

442,"as someone who watched the next generation and deep space 9 i'll say this. when the next generation ended i was sad cause ok that's one last show to watch but when ds9 ended...i cried, that was rough. bashir and o'brian had the ultimate bromance.worf and jadzia were well done. (not an ezri fan)quark and his speech about humans was epicsisko is a badass. jake...not so muchodo you poor bastard but on the flip side your lady was the hottest one on the show. in real life bashir was the lucky one.my only complain...dont like vic fontaine... like...at all",1

447,i loved this one. i few years ago i began to try and watch all treks from episode 1 season until the end.  ds9 was easy!,1
448,i like how they fleshed out the ferengi better. one of the best things about ds9 is how the ferengi where more dimensional that just profit hunger optimistic.,1

(the outlier here is market forces, which i couldn't quite connect to and was a dnf for me.)also, the sparrow by mary doria rusell is one of the best novels i ever read. not just genre, but in general.    the synopsys may sound errr unappealing - jesuits manage to fund and launch a flight to newly discovered exoplanet with intelligent life before anyone else. however, it comes with an incredible plot and characters and the author came up with a superb way to tell the story. the storyline spools out in two lines - the begining and the dreadful end, so one chapter you're reading on the giddy prep, and the next you slowly learn how it all went horribly wrong.   just one jesuit is on the flight. :)",1

567,"got easily wins this one. it's a household name by this point, everyone and their mother got into it, it was the biggest piece of entertainment of the last 10 years.how it ended doesn't change that. the ending itself just made it infamous, mere salty redditors can't push a joke petition for a s8 remake to 1.8m signatures. the ending was rightly hated by a huge part of the audience and the entire cultural impact of the show ended in an instant. can you see any got hype right now? everyone just forgot it, because at the end it sucked so bad it made you unable to rewatch the show without turning off the first episode 5 minutes in.that last season was just the cherry on top the crap-cake that were s5-8. in s5-6 half the storylines were botched, by s7 it was all dumb plots and action emphasis. action scenes were shot well and technical execution, music and acting were top notch. but the writing has been taking a deep dive since s5 onward. it went from a 9.5/10 show for 4 seasons to a 6/10 show at best for s5-7 and a 0/10 for s8.lost, by comparison, was a different show. it was clear to me from like halfway into season 2 they were just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. it had several great executed moments, but they were never a part of something constantly well-written and high-level, as got was for half its run. it never had an intricately crafted overall story to follow.things were introduced and underwhelmingly moved aside or abruptly dropped all the time there. well, not all the time, but plenty of times to make an impression, and it always relied on the mystery box approach to keep you invested.it was always parts of some plotlines that were decent and exciting - the rest of the time it was a wheel-spinning mess, flashback/sideways-ing with minor characters that rarely contributed much, and chasing something that never amounted to anything more than fucking purgatory. the mystery box with nothing inside.george better finish winds soon, i need it after 10 years of waiting.",1

803,the tv series has a genuine charm the movie never really managed to recreate. it's pretty dated now but it still holds up i think.if you enjoy that i'd also recommend red dwarf again it's very dated and the first 2 seasons are very rough but seasons 3-6 are probably amongst the best live action sci-fi comedy ever made.,1

882,"lets say their is a war, factories are targeted, riots ensue, national collapse, environmental disasters occur, fresh water is fought over, and billions are lost. in this scenario, technological collapse would be massive. of course, this is a stretch since global collapse would have to take place, this would only be a science fiction related occurrence because we as humans haven’t faced such circumstances yet, and most likely wont for quite some time. but let’s say millions of years from now, and we have created colonies on the moon, mars, or an asteroid, and for some reason that colony is faced with national collapse, disease, natural disaster, or simply war, it will be harder and harder to destabilize the higher technology has advanced. since these colonies are fairly isolated, the only way for them to avoid technological collapse would be to a) have separate communities to divide technology production to ensure infrastructural survival or b) rely on outside communities for technological imports and infrastructural aid.there are examples of this occurring in history on a smaller scale, and could be repeated on a larger one if we face a great filter in the future. my favorite (albeit morbid)  is the mayan collapse, disease came in just before spanish officials arrived in the capital, hundreds of thousands were already sick in outlying regions causing early urban collapse. by the time the spanish officials arrived and mingled with the capital, many more got sick, and due to the mayan lifestyle, disease spread quite quickly. soon mayan citizens attacked and killed a few spanish officals, causing the remaining parties to leave. the mayan people got sicker, and sicker, the city faced famine, drought from lack of abled bodied workers, and was full of dead corpses. those few who survived witnessed their world collapse, and many artisans who could make technologically advanced goods at the time were lost, many resulted self banishing to the wilderness and avoided the plagued city. the mayan culture never bounced back, but a few mayans did survive and remembered what happened.if this is tl:dr, then i’ll put it simply, civilization collapse is quite possible and has occurred, it is harder to happen currently with multiple technologically advanced nations, but possible. global collapse could happen, but would need great filter-like circumstances to occur and is not suspected to happen in our life time currently.",1

983,"i felt totally different about this. here’s my review:high life (2018) i award 2/5 stars.my issue succinctly can be summed up by that there were 3 writers credited for the movie and it certainly felt that way while watching it. there were parts i loved and parts i hated and unfortunately it just felt like a jumbled mess. first warning to the wise, the movie is very different from the trailer. the trailer (to me) implied a character driven sci-fi thriller of people trapped aboard a derelict ship. in reality, the movie is very much a product of its famous director (who i was unaware of previously) and is largely a french new wave arthouse film set in space.what i lovedthere are many things about the movie i did enjoy, though i admit i flopped back and forth a couple of times through-out the movie. for one, it feels and looks a lot of the time like a  70's era pulp sci-fi. the ship and costuming and science are very much the antithesis of hard sci-fi. at first this bothered me, i think because i'm used to more modern sci-fi, but as time went on i came back around to it. it was nostalgic without leaning on nostalgia.what i was enjoying most about the movie was that it began in media res. the camera pans over a humid and wet garden set amongst rough-hewn steel in soft greens and blues. as the camera rotates it ends on a shot of a shoe sticking halfway out of the soft garden dirt before pulling out and behind the plastic curtains you encounter at supermarkets in the cold section. i was hooked. excitedly, i prepared myself for the mystery of ""what happened here and what will these people do now?"" as the camera crawled around the interior of the ship, following the sounds of a chattering baby. we pass old brown blood stains on the wall, scrawled graffiti, and jumbled plastic bins left around haphazardly. clearly there is a story here.what i did not likeunfortunately what i didn't like can be summed up by one 2 minute scene that happened about 10-15 minutes after the beginning i've already described. we see a train passing through a bleak countryside. on the train is an older man and a younger woman. the woman is interviewing him and calls him professor. professor then expositories about the people they've sent up into space and how there is no hope for them. end scene. these people are never shown or mentioned ever again. the scene's one purpose is the hold your hand and explain things that you were already beginning to pick up on. this continues throughout the movie. much of the movie is implied and left up to the viewer to piece together, which i appreciate. clues and hints are left in the characters, the set design, etc. and yet, anytime someone opens their mouth they then talk to the viewer and explain everything which is immensely frustrating and annoying.the way the characters were used also bothered me. on one hand, the movie does present a grim character study of what does it mean to be alone in space, in addition to not only being the usual type who goes to space because they choose to for some lofty goal, but rather that the people sent are the rejects of society. how do these band of criminals form their own society? can they work together to move beyond their past and create a new future? what happens when a baby is born into this new world of theirs? how will she be affected as she grows older? unfortunately, the movie drops the ball on this and doesn't pursue it to an end. indeed, rather than allowing us into this world and picking up hints of the past while focusing on robert pattinson raising his daughter (which to me would have been the interesting portion), for the majority of the movie it's all flashbacks to before willow (the baby) was born. within these flashbacks are flashbacks to the convicts time on earth; i suppose with the intent of showing us that people are people and come from different lives? largely, i felt this to be pointless. show, don't tell.the plotthe plot was also jumbled. half of it i loved, half of it i hated. the basic premise is that society has taken death row inmates and sent them into space to act as scientific guinea pigs. not a new idea, but a valid and good one, worth exploring in new ways. for this particular mission, the primary goal is to explore fertility in space. the idea of generational ships is also not a new one, but the movie brings up the point that there is radiation in space. can humans even procreate? that was new and interesting to me, but it doesn't explore that plot point either. nor does it capitalize on what it means to be a child born into that society, as i previously mentioned. indeed, the movie ends !|| by fast-forwarding past all the interesting parts of willow's childhood to when she is a 16 year old girl who is surprisingly clever, well spoken, and well adjusted. her and her father are now pursuing the conclusion of their mission with a random additional exploration of conducting experiments by shooting themselves into a black hole. the same experiment we saw briefly earlier in the movie that killed her mother. credits roll as they move forward into the black hole.||!<conclusioni gave the movie two stars because i am very disappointed. i felt there were many interesting threads and scenes and pieces in the movie that could have been explored, but instead the movie picked up all these different parts, played with them briefly, and then set them back down again to move on to something else. there was no clarity to the movie and it was largely a jumbled mess.however, i am clearly reviewing the movie and judging it from a perspective of a sci-fi/thriller/drama. i have no experience with french new wave arthouse and can not judge it on that merit. perhaps it succeeds in that regard. i will say however that i saw the movie with my girlfriend who is more experienced in that genre than i and she wasn't a fan of the movie either. there is one interesting scene in the movie to that end that did cause me to think: !||we see one of the prisoners attempting to rape one of the women before he is caught and killed by the other prisoners. the movie clearly presents this as bad and evil. however, in the next scene we see the female doctor raping robert pattinson. the scene is filmed sensuously with soft light and sweet music playing. viscerally, we are supposed to view this as a love scene, however it is clearly rape as pattinson has been drugged into sleep. coming on the heels of the prior scene, it felt intentional. i assume the director was asking us to explore how society views rape on women vs men, but as the rest of the movie is so jumbled, i'm cautious to ascribe intent to what may have been accidental.||!<",1

1231,"huh? you are arbitrarily deciding that sci-fi = you think it is based on science, but you aren't citing to anyone who agrees. you are just stating it. which is fine if that's important to you but, my point is that a lot of sci-fi is not based on science at all. actually, almost nothing in sci-fi is rooted in science. the vast majority of sci-fi is just a made up technology that is used as a mcguffin to drive the plot.but the best sci-fi almost always uses a made up universe to make a point.star trek has absolutely nothing to do with science. it is 100% about morality in a utopian future where we have moved past economic want... through technology that could easily be magic (but it's more optimistic if the magic is something we made so, roddenberry used tech). the matrix has nothing to do with science either. it's basically the gnostic philosophy restated through vr while set in a dystopian future that was drawn heavily from gibson's neuromancer -- which itself was not science, but a reflection of the dystopian world gibson says he saw all around him.battlestar galactica is completely noir tackling modern politics episode to episode in another part of the galaxy. there's no ""science"" in that show either.star wars is the classic messiah/fairy tale journey blended with influences from wwii movies and spaghetti westerns. nothing in it is science. but all of the set pieces are the exact same things you see throughout sci-fi.that's why bookstores/amazon/etc. sell star wars in the sci-fi aisle, and disney spends millions marketing it alongside other sci-fi offerings. you can say you disagree with that characterization, which is fine if that matters to you. i just pointed out that arguing over whether it is sci-fi (which is what the creators call it) or fantasy (what you call it), doesn't really matter to me as much as ""is it any good?""",1

1299,"andromeda starts pretty strong, good first two or three seasons and then kinda slopes down a little. personally i felt its biggest issue was a lead character (maybe actor) who is given to much attention/spotlight, especially later on. i compare dylan hunt to shatners cpt. kirk. that being said it’s still pretty good. very similar to the star trek episodic style with a decent overarching plot. it was originally conceived by gene roddenberry after all. i get the sense that there was a definite plan for the entire story from the get go but it feels like the show may have fallen prey to producers wanting/making changes based on ratings/money. as others have said, stargate is pretty fantastic if you want a version of star trek that’s just a little bit more military focused. still plenty of idealism and exploration of classic sci-fi tropes and concepts, just a little more action. lexx. it’s strange. like really strange. first season is great on its own as it’s four 90min episodes. season two follows pretty clearly after that and has a standard american length season(for a 90s show). season three moves in a different direction, still interesting if you’ve gone through the first two seasons so why not keep going. and the season 4. wow season 4. there is some amazing satire about america in season 4 but again it stays away from the style and feel of its previous seasons. also if you do watch lexx, be prepared for a lot of sexual innuendo. 1995 outer limits is great for an anthology seriesand for one final recommendation. this is one is probably the farthest from “sci-fi” and more in line with any other sitcom. but i truly love 3rd rock from the sun. it follows aliens disguised as a non traditional human family trying to understand the human condition. again it’s hardly what i would call sci-fi but the writing is great and jon lithgow has some of the best comedic timing.",1

1309,"love babylon 5 and the 3 90s star trek shows! i agree it's super hard to scratch that itch, though.stargate is fun. it can be a little slow, and can be a little campy at times... but i feel like it fits in with some of the star trek pacing. also i kinda feel like some of the inter-personal dynamics can have a b5 feel at times, in a 90s sort of way (like sinclair's relationships/command styles with his senior officers, etc). they are in basically present time, though, but so much is off planet and even though the humans don't have sci fi tech and stuff really at first, i love the way it slowly gets integrated as they learn more about the way the galaxy and alien species work. also the over-arching plots are nowhere near as interesting or compelling as b5, but honestly are there any show that match b5? the expanse has a lot going for it, and it is a well written show - coming from a book probably helps - but the scale and pacing is pretty different from b5. if you haven't watched, it's worth a shot. i liked seasons 2 and 3 best by far - season 1 didn't do a ton for me. otherwise, yeah, i honestly feel like there just aren't a ton of great, epic-scale, well done space sci-fi shows out there, and it makes me sad. even the ""good"" ones feel like they're often missing something.the new lost in space was better than i expected, which isn't saying much. it's not mind blowing... i kinda think of it like the 100. not amazing, but can be fine when i want some sci fi and don't have anything else.  if you don't mind anime and animated stuff, there might be some great stories worth exploring there that could scratch that itch. also, just to float it - some awesome books that hit on the epic scale, aliens, spaceships stuff, too. i just finished becky chambers' trilogy, starting with the long way to a small angry planet, and it was super fun and pretty easy to get into.",1

1331,"the show was originally written as a 5 year arc.  just before s4 started production it looked like the entire network he was on was going to fail and it was highly unlikely he'd get more than s4 in.  so, he pulled all the ""fluff"" episodes out of s4 and dumped most of the earth/b5 conflict storeline so that everything could be wrapped by the end of s4. as s4 was airing things turned around and they were renewed for s5.   the final episode for the show had in fact already been filmed so what he did was film a replacement for the s4/show finale, pulled pulled the original s4/show finale, and started writing s5. that's why s5 stumbles a bit because he put back in some of the stuff he wanted to do but might not be as strong, and stretched out the storylines re earth/b5 that shouldn't have taken a full season.   the final episode of s5/the series that went to air was the episode originally filmed as the end of s4.now if you want to watch jms fall on his face, check out the sequal, crusade.  the network interfered constantly forcing rewrites on the fly, uniform changes he didn't want, and changes in episode airing that made no sense from a story line point of view. it was so broken.  the funniest part happened online though. within minutes of the first episode airing people were pointing out that the story was 99.99% a rip off of a classic anime, star blazers. both shows were about an alien race that lost a war with earth but on the way out poisoned earth.  in both cases the poison was going to take a fixed number of years to adapt to earth and wipe it out.  in both cases earth adapted technology from mysterious aliens that it barely understood to create a hybrid ship that was sent on a mission to find aliens and/or alien tech that could be used to save the earth.  in both cases the ship had a ridiculously overpowered main gun that could destroy anything that it fired upon but this alien designed main gun was too powerful for the ship leaving the ship unpowered and helpless for a period of time after the gun was fired.   if you like reading sci fi there were 3 trilogies that were written based on outlines from jms that are canon and they are very good.   one explores stories around the centari, including vir's ascendancy to the throne that we get a 2 minute glimpse of in the show, one explores the psi corp, including a lot on bester, and one looks at the technomages that we only saw 1 episode of in the show.  the technomage books also give you some nice insight to both the vorlon and shadows.jms denied he copied anything but a few days later came back online and said he had gotten a copy of the pilot for the cartoon and having watched it he now remembered seeing it in his youth and admitted he must have been inspired by it without being aware.  some fans took to referring to the crusade ship as the yamato, the name of the ship from the anime.crusade didn't make it through its first season.and thank you for this trip down memory lane.   maybe its time for a rewatch, its been a few years.",1

1353,"sci-fi is dependent upon one thing: science. because of that, there's three levels of sci-fi: 1 - not sci-fi, but with sci-fi elements - science, by definition should exist in the story. if it's not, it's just ""fiction with spaceships."" or, as some people call it, space opera. good examples are star wars, firefly, fifth element, and the michael bay transformers movies. babylon 5 even debatably falls in this category. most of the mcu is this.2 - soft sci-fi - this is where science is involved in the story and is somehow central, but it gets lofty and might not all make sense. this is most sci-fi. this is star trek, the matrix, bsg, avatar, terminator, etc. 3. hard sci-fi - this is where hard, factual science is laid out bare and the entire story revolves around science. this doesn't get made into movies or shows very often. you'd be looking at movies like the martian, primer, contact, and pi. the recent show devs would also work. more common in books like neal stephenson's seveneves and cryptonomicon or even michael crichton books like jurassic park and sphere.of course, there are always things that will straddle these main categories, too. interstellar, for example, exists somewhere between hard and soft sci-fi. farscape exists somewhere between soft sci-fi and not sci-fi. i'm not here to argue the nitty gritty details. i'm here to explain where the subcategories are commonly demarcated.",1

1542,"ham-fisted or not (and i’m not disagreeing with you on that), the author’s intent was a cohesive shared setting. tmiahm is often included in the future history list, i’ve even seen some versions that justify siasl being there. starship troopers, as far as i know, is not connected in any way though. i think there’s a distinction to be made between works that “stands alone” and works that “don’t exist within a shared universe.” those two ideas aren’t exactly the same. the vast majority of heinlein’s works (especially the novel-length stuff) stands alone just fine and one can read most of them in any order without realizing any of the connections, but the existence of shared characters and histories within those works implies that those stand alone stories coexist in a single universe (or multiverse) for sure.",1

1608,"to clarify - it's not that i would have wanted voyager to be exactly like bsg. but at least if they took their own premise more serious (stranded in the delta quadrant) - and did way more serialized stories (ironically, i'm sick of serialized ""trek"" like discovery...) - but i know, i know... it was ye olden days of television and way too easy to miss an episode... or ten... (even with vcr's...). so, they stuck to the good ole episodic and the magic reset button that made the ship 100% new and shiny after every major event, space battle and whatnot. sadly, voyager also felt a bit stale after having seen the more or less same stories before  on tng and ds9... space anomalies are soooo boring - same with the lame old ""planet of the week"". again - and more irony incoming: i hope, the upcoming ""captain pike show"" will be so much more like that...",1

1630,that's like 25 episodes a season!i'm sorry but not worth the pain.,1
1632,"i'll try to keep this spoiler free.  ds9 is very much a series about the characters.  each of them has a journey over the course of those 7 seasons, even the minor characters. they're all very different people at the end than they were at the start, which isn't really something you can say about the other classic series.  along the way they examine some interesting questions about politics, religion, faith, friendship, war--basically, many aspects of the human condition. it also holds up a mirror to the federation and examines it in a way none of the other star trek series have done. heck, it even manages to redeem one of tng's great shortcomings by making the ferengi more than just comic relief.  i don't think ds9 starts slowly at all, but then i really like the character studies that make up the bulk of the early episodes. the rest are largely about setting up the situation with bajor and its post-occupation rebuilding.it's our first in depth look at a single culture in star trek, and i think it works. so imo, you have a well written character drama that tells intriguing stories that are different from other trek series. if i had to make a top 10 list of star trek episodes from the classic series, as many as 5 of them would be from ds9.",1

1694,just started season 3.  definitely felt like something was going to happen along those lines... but no spoilers please.  : )   t'pol probably our least favorite character.  but we both agree that archer is the worst starfleet captain ever.  just so many bad decisions.  he would have been court martialed after the 2nd episode...,1

1701,"not gonna lie, fam, i loved the twist. however, i think the last frame should be showing the door slamming shut (calling back to the previous chapter) instead of the silhouette because a double twist doesn't do it for me and it sort of breaks the rules established so far in the universe instead of extrapolating upon them. if the fourth guy got back then obviously the magic of the island wasn't real so they'd have no reason to kill him in the first place.anyway good luck my dude hope you keep creating.",1

(i also hadn't liked that starfleet imprisonment had been so idyllic, there could have been some interesting and terrible secret to all of that).    if we had gotten the untrustworthy chakotay that people are rooting for in this thread overall, then tom could have been a tortured keystone who saw the ideals of janeway and his father on one side, but a fellow fight-the-system mentor in chakotay.    i think a darker version of chakotay would have made an amazing mentor to a more uncertain and broken tom.",1

1796,"makes sense with their situations, too. stuck out alone on voyager, chakotay's more friendly, 1-on-1, get to know the crew style really fits. he's almost got a bit of riker and troy's roles rolled into one. riker is friendly, but he's still the first officer on a federation flagship and respects that chain of command. he's actually pretty cold with a lot of the crew!",1

1807,"that's a lot more reasonable. of course if other people's opinions are ""this person's life has no worth"" then there will always be violence. i think addressing the cause rather than attempting to ensure punishment or prevention of violence is more desirable/effective, especially when people with those beliefs hold privileged positions of power.i think we've pretty much hashed out as much as we can without beginning to spin in circles, but i wanted to thank you for the conversation! one of the things i miss most about the pre-covid days is talking to random people with differing opinions. while reddit doesn't fully scratch that itch, sometimes it helps! wishing you luck in finding more awesome sci-fi, and in everything else.",1

1810,it is also interesting to see what the second string is like.,1
1811,the main reason enterprise gets so much hate is that it has the most out of place intro song in all of star trek. faith of the heart? from the title alone it sounds like a christian rock song. who okayed that song?,1

1813,"i think i found a way to quantify it. just word count the 'friends' section for the respective characters on memory alpha. picard, despite being one of the top two characters in the franchise and much more popular, has only 200 words more than janeway. now, sure picard isn't the sort to go out and make friends, someone like riker sure is. 2000 words. chakotay? 3400. there's just so much more character interaction, and it doesn't seem to be for the benefit of random drama.sure, maybe there's some very dedicated people on memory alpha, but there's got to be a root cause.",1
1814,"tos is my facorite because it's so iconic. everything you say is true. it's dated, it's cheesy, the writing is just bad sometimes, and the acting, well. but i'm just in love with all the characters of tos. they're figures drawn in broad strokes, they leave room for the viewer's imagination. the whole show did that too, and maybe that's part of the reason why the fans wouldn't let it die.",1

1823,i also gave my vote to voyager. it was the star trek that introduced me to the universe. it's what i grew up on; it's what i love. seeing the poll results as they currently stand - i feel genuinely happy that voyager is seated third.,1
1824,"100% feel this. like it was the show that i just most consistently enjoyed. sure i thought tng had the best actors and some of the strongest st moments because of it, with patrick stewart. sure i think ds9 has the best over-arching, season-spanning plot, and deep culture dives. but i think voyager most consistently was fun to watch. also shout out for sg-1. even with the slog!",1

1830,i agree but this is mostly because of serialization. shows used to be aired out of order and had reruns. we take for granted the way shows are run now.,1
1831,"oh man, tuvok was great. it was great getting to explore one of the original st cultures through a character like that. instead of a ""half vulcan"" or ""half betazoid"" or a ""klignon raised by humans."" i love that there are a lot of moments where it's like ""oh, right, this guy is not just a human with pointy ears.""(and to be fair, that's what i loved about ds9 too... we really got to go deep with the cardassian and bajoran cultures. even the klignons got some love!)",1

1840,"well there would never have been a next generation without the first generation. so by your own logic, tos gets your vote.",1
1841,i'm slowing pushing through it but it's not at the pace i enjoyed the others. i want to love it because i find the way picard handles things really enjoyable but the monster of the week style combined with people not speaking up is making it harder. maybe it's just because i am used to longer story arks in shows these days. it is nice having plot lines solved without blow shit up though.,1
1842,"the original series, nothing will top kirk and spock played by shatner and nimoy for me. i do have a soft spot for tng, i love jean luc picard.",1

1848,"the early episodes of tng are a little hard to get through at times. they were finding their characters and their rhythm. but once that show got rolling, it was unbelievably great, and so were the films it spawned. i have a lot of love for those characters: picard, worf, data, crusher, riker, geordi, o'brien, troi (and her mom!), guinan, q, barclay (broccoli!) ... man, the interplay and growth that occurred was so fun. i miss it.",1

1851," they where completly isolated from starfleet & the rest of the federation, but still magically the ship was always fine & they where fully stocked on weapons, etc. the only time they struggled was in lip service to a plot hole.what kills me is that they even acknowledged this problem with the (excellent) equinox arc. they stared it right in the face, but didn't really address it at all.",1
1852,"the slaver weapon (s01e14) was an adaptation of niven's short story the soft weapon, set in the known space universe. it was adapted for trek, but they kept a lot of the known space elements, like the kzin.",1
1853,i've recently watched ds9 and voyager and enjoyed them both but tng stopped me in my tracks. there are just too many episodes that would easily be resolved by the person having the issue talking to the captain and the captain believing them but it never seems to happen. if they do manage to talk to someone about their problem no one believes them even though every episodes there is some crazy shenanigans that cause them to question what they know.,1
1854,i know i’m gonna get shit for this because voyager is the least liked series i’m pretty sure. but i understand a lot of star trek fans like the civil side of things and don’t really like the combat or violence in the shows. but i liked voyager because i felt like it focused on this. plus it explores a lot of new ideas that are interesting. i mean they learned to revert a borg to mostly human which led to them getting 7 of 9 which is (pardon me) one of the hottest if not the hottest character in star trek. then they found a species that was stronger than borg and started hunting them to use their superior tech and they were badass. they had klingons invade their ship and take it over and use their holodeck as hinting simulations and forced them to be prey. we got black vulcans. we got space indians. shits awesome bruh. why did everyone hate it though.,1

1872,"there's no easy answer to that one: ""because when time ends, the birds and hippos and lions and deer at disneyland will no longer be simulations, and, for the first time, a real bird will sing."" - from ""how to build a universe that doesn't fall apart two days later.""(",1
1873,"don't forget the chief, nog and rom",1
1874,"they all have significant pluses and minuses. so i don't know.what i do know is that if i did have a favorite, it definitely wouldn't be any of the new ones on cbs all access.",1
1875,"all other series are just shadows of the original.  just because they're newer, or have higher production values, or more neato special effects, does not make them any better.    yeah, i know ... ""ok, boomer.""  but, s'truth.",1
1876,i’ve always felt the same way about s4 of ent - the single best season of any trek. unfortunately seasons one and two killed the ratings and any chance of a longer run. so ds9 still gets my vote for best overall.,1
1877,"in all fairness, they could have found a way to replace them later.",1
1878,yeswhich one was the larry niven story??,1
1879,okey thanks,1
1880,"i went against my better judgement and voted for voyager too. maybe i'm a different person now, but about a decade ago i marathoned sg-1, tng and voy. sg-1 became a slog. tng started to blend all together.now, that's not to say that the tng or stargate sg-1 or particularly ds9 aren't better. they probably are. but in terms of variety on a week-by-week basis voyager wins. even when it's bad at least the bad episodes are more unique from it's other episodes from the others series i mentioned here.and over time i have come to believe ever more that it's the characters that make a story, that help you suspend your disbelief and just engage with that world. and if i count up the characters i care about, that i want to see more of and how they interact with the others on the show, in both number and percentage, voyager beats them all. and that's what makes it my favourite.",1
1881,"there wasn't much diplomacy and don't remind me about the war, that was a terrible arc.",1

1885, grieger,1
1886,"the image of you furiously clicking words instead of reading them is hilarious.as i said: when i called you an idiot, i was being too kind.",1
1887,"enterprise is underappreciated. it had a grittier feel to it that made it feel more realistic. it probably came out too soon since the fans had been watching consistent star trek series for more than ten years already. the writing was terrible in a lot of episodes and the plot was crappy. i thought t'pol was really just there for eye candy. if they waited a couple of years to round out things a bit, maybe the fans would have been ready for a new series, the stories could have had time to develop, maybe cast a different actress for t'pol, then it could have had a good seven seasons and ended well instead of the train wreck it turned into.",1
1888,"the rotating cast concept is something that i loved about shield. kept it interesting, kept you on your toes because they had license to kill people off.",1
1889,"i can understand why voyager wouldn't be someone's favourite, but it does have a huge amount of good to go with all the fuck ups and it's well worth a watch. one thing i don't think gets brought up enough is just how fucking incredible tuvok is. he manages to be a 'proper' vulcan, i.e. not one struggling with emotional problems or being half-human, while still feeling 'human'. he has emotions, he keeps them suppressed, but he never feels cold. there's also something inherently interesting in being a vulcan - who suppress emotion out of fear of their violence - being a security officer. admittedly though that's linked to one of voyager's bad points,  many of it's characters had very interesting concepts like him that should have been expanded on, but it so often failed to properly do that. see all of the maquis who's renegade nature is rarely brought up, or neelix, who's background is that of a han solo figure only pretending to be a fool. at some point, obviously it went wrong.",1
1890,"i read his instrumentalities series and it’s literally the first book series where i couldn’t stop reading. it was a constant struggle for sleep against the “one more page” urge. i’ve read more than my share of books. i love reading. but this was the first time an entire damn series maintained my enthusiasm so completely. mr. cook, if you’re reading this please continue the series.",1
1891,what season are you guys on?  my one really big problem actually centers around t’pol’s relationship with a certain character...,1
1892,i'm with you too.,1
1893,"enterprise was honestly pretty good.  seasons 1 and 2 has some fun upbeat exploration (the decontamination thing is the one thing that’s really weird to me), season 3 was fun and the later half to me is some of the best trek (episode 20 of season 3 may be my favorite trek period), and 4 has some real fun situations.  the whole multiple arc thing in season 4 was really good to me.  also t’pol and archer’s dynamic is the best.",1
1894,it will always be tng for me. that’s the one i grew up with. i started with original series with my dad and he’s watched all but ds9 and voyager. i’ve watched all but picard. not every single episode necessarily but i’d say 90% of them and i will always have a soft spot for tng,1
1895,"not really, but in practice the few things that make it different (the corset mainly) we're really uncomfortable for the actress. also for someone obsessed with perfection it's not really practical to wear a corset or heels and yet we have em. with troi she is a feminine person who cares about her appearance. but 7 shouldn't care about appearance so it's more conspicuous. disclaimer voyager is my favorite and seven birthed a obsession with tight clothes that i have never gotten over.",1
1896,"fun fact, ronald d moore had planned to have voyager play out play out as very serialised show. he had lots of ideas about how the show would move forward. then as ds9 wasnt doing so hot in the rating as some higher ups would have liked, they shifted the show to be more tng. the silver lining is that all those ideas that moore had we got to see anyway in little show called battlestar galatica.",1
1897,"at first i thought it was very unsettling too, but the cgi was so cartoony it ended up taking me out of the moment.",1
1898,fellow stellarier! haha hi.someone suggested to me imperial radch trilogy (anne leckie)and some recent series:altered carbondark matterkilljoysdeath sex robots (short animated mature films),1

1900,red country is abercrombie’s spaghetti western.,1
1901,"tos, by a mile. when i'm flipping channels and run across an original series episode, i immediately stop to see which one it is, often watching it. if i happen to pass over any other series i just keep changing the channel. i liked tng, but my opinion on it has gotten a little worse over the years. i didn't like enterprise much on first viewing. rewatched it last summer and liked it a lot...but the finale is still one of the worst in tv history, definitely the worst trek finale ever. voyager started out really bad. starting with season 4 it turned out pretty decent. haven't watched enough of ds9 to form an overall opinion (just random episodes) i like discovery enough, but it feels forced sometimes. love captain pike tho, hyped for that series. he saved season 2 of disc for me. picard started out good, but steadily declined towards the end.most of the votes are being done out of nostalgia, or based on what people have watched. i would guess that most voters have only watched 1-3 complete series.",1
1902,"i love the animated series! it's the best medium for really wacky, outlandish sci-fi stuff. i loved that some of the aliens were genuinely alien - because, why not? it's animated!plus, they got to do a larry niven story, which was dope.",1
1903,"ripley scottlol, i liked the op's typo/idea of ""ripley scott"" too ! you might be underestimating gigers infamy at just 99.87% :)",1
1904,"no, no pay to win. at least, not on pc.",1
1905,"i grew up with tng and have watched it in its entirety 4 times so far, not counting all the reruns from my childhood. however, i just finished ds9 for the first time ever, and even after only one viewing it has become my favorite trek. i love tng, i always will, and it’s the epitome of what i love about the franchise. but ds9 takes all of that in a new direction, and i’ve fallen in love with it.",1

""i'm called an officer so i must be an officer, and i'm called a friend so i must be a friend""? what's the big deal there? and then ""if you don't have faith then all you can do is work""? so are you saying it's a good thing or a bad thing to have no faith and only duty? do you mean no faith in a higher power, or no faith in your own abilities, or no faith in others????just nonsense.",1

1916,although i know that deep space 9 is the best writtendoubt( haven't seen discovery or picard but i'd say next gen is by far and away the best written.  ds9 was basically friends in space.,1

1920,"i chose tng but that is mostly nostalgia fueled. i really liked voy and don’t agree with the negativity in this thread regards voy. mulgrew was good, jerry ryan did some stellar work and except for the typical crappy ep per season i really liked it. picard i also liked very much but it is not trek in the sense that tng or ds9 are. i like it, could care less about the swearing in picard. i want to see new q episodes and can’t wait for season 2. discovery is the one that i can’t seem to grasp. it goes all over the place, the pacing is weird, so many story arcs and burnham does not give me the sense that i care about her adventure. it sure is shiny space visual effects but the story, meh.",1
1921,"i’d say ds9 is the strongest as a series, with the best cast of characters. but cpt. picard is the single best character trek has ever had and tng’s best episodes are the best trek ever had.",1
1922,and maybe if he killed off neelix first.,1
1923,i honestly didn't enjoy the first couple seasons. especially neelix. i found him annoying. but by the end i think i had a net positive opinion.,1
1924,"fun! i loved stellaris... especially the early game exploring when you just have a couple ships. for epic space-opera-y books: the long way to a small angry planet, a closed and common orbit, and record of a spaceborn few by becky chambers are awesome, fun, chill, interesting, and galactic-scale-multi-species-civilization stuff. fast reads, as well. each book has a slightly different style and scale to the story, so some folks only like 1 or 2 of them. i honestly liked them all. light by m john harrison is one of my favorite books. part space-ship sci fi, part just... weird. pretty easy to get in to, too.  ancillary justice and the sequels by ann leckie are also some of my favorites. some folks don't love them because the narrator has some weird perspective stuff going on... but i love them. so, there. other galactic civ/epic scale type stuff... the uplift series by david brin (the whole idea of uplifting a primitive species is a part of stellaris, too, and totally a nod to this series), culture novels by iain m banks, hyperion cantos books by dan simmons. binti by nnedi okorafor is as well, and is pretty short if you want to get into something quick.",1
1925,"yeah. i heard him talk on a podcast (i think marc maron's) about how initially he felt pressured to constantly include his typical low-brow humor and end every scene with a punchline because that's what people had come to expect from him, but that as the writing process continued and he and the other writers started feeling more comfortable with the material that pressure went away and they made a concious decision to put the emphasis on storytelling first and allow the humor to come more naturally where it made sense rather than to force it. you can definitely feel that shift partway through and the show's the better for it.",1
1926,enterprise is definitely my favorite after ds9 and tng.  i'm really surprised that disco is now getting more votes than ent.  disc is at the bottom of my list.,1
1927,thanks a lot <3,1
1928,"yeah, that's definitely not what this is. stellaris is sort of like a civilization-type game, but absolutely a love-letter to galactic-civ type stories, books, shows, etc. i can totally see someone wanting to explore more epic sci fi books/shows/etc after playing!",1
1929,"picard is my favorite character but ds9 had better characters overall. kira, odo, quark, sisko, hell even worf was better in ds9 in my opinion! tng might also have some of the greatest single episodes of the entire trek series, but ds9 has more great episodes overall. plus it experimented with continuity really successfully!",1
1930,"yeah but even at it's most warlike in ds9  their main mission was one of exploration and peace over all that. nu trek is just explosions and plotlines that go nowhere. also  the ""social commentary"" about xenophobia and war has been done better in other star trek series many times over. rogue membersagents inside of starfleet has been done to death in almost every st series as well and in the movies. the worse part about it is they didn't really bother to set up how and why these things happened in picard they just do and you are forced to roll with that. they had an entire season to build a world where this made sense and they failed miserably.",1
1931,try galaxy's edge — legionnaires. very starship troopers/star wars influence.,1
1932,i grew up watching tos with my dad. it'll always be the best to me.,1
1933,"overall, mine's ds9, but i think there's a strong case to be made for tng also. ds9 was the most consistently well-written show and had the strongest characters, but tng had higher highs imo. i consider episodes like best of both worlds, the inner light, and all good things to be some of the absolute best science fiction stories ever put to screen and nothing else, not even ds9, as great as that show was in its own right, has ever quite topped tng when it was at its absolute best.",1
1934,"surprised that picard is not higher.  definitely had some issues w/ plotting, but i thought the writing overall was much better than discovery.  kind of unfair to have only one season of the show to compare with, since we all know that the first seasons are always pretty bad.looking forward to the inevitable q encounter.  (i know, i know)",1

1944,i would love to know if the one: a cruise through the solar system is optimistic if anybody has read it,1
1945,"the orvilleyassss...mostly because it's an obvious love letter but what really won me over was the way the moral quandaries are rarely tied off with a neat little bow. hard situations do not magically become easy when someone gives a speech; these issues remain ugly and unjust as often as not, and we get to see people live with them and adapt to them. that's a brave thing to do in an american show that doubles as a space opera romp. it never flinches but it also never wallows. it may wear its values on its sleeve just the way trek always has, but it also recognizes the improbability of the utopian vision and it never feels preachy, but somehow it remains fundamentally hopeful.that's something you can only pull off if you love the source material and actively want it to be better.most trek shows post voyager have all the superficial elements down, but they lack the beating heart of star trek, its sense of wonder and hope (imho). orville has that heart.",1

1950,"one major factor is that it’s main demographic is the most likely to have canceled cable, or never subscribed in the first place.   another is that it requires a lot of viewer attention and engagement and a large portion of the tv audience won’t do that.  there’s a lot of viewers like my brother who would rather just watch family guy reruns while he plays around on his phone.   anything with a plot deeper than mud puddle is confusing when you are paying more attention to facebook than the tv.",1

1991,"the way they tried to model the xindi on the experiences of 9/11 and bring out those parts of human society that really are imperfect is something that could have been done much better. archer's desparation is handled well, and explains some of the acts he commits while on the mission, but it's clear they had the shadow of not just 9/11 but of battlestar galactica haunting them.battlestar galactica's major problem was that in a lazy examination of how people deal with terrorism or torture or something basically became nearly unwatchable as it had turned largely into battlestar giraqtica , complete with a meditation on the torturers and the tortured. enterprise suffered similarly.i think such examinations are absolutely critical and necessary sometimes, but i couldn't help reflect back on the situation with babylon 5, and how when one of the major characters is being coerced for a confession, instead of beating someone or spacing them or plucking an eye out, the genius of writing makes babylon 5 a study in contract, in how it should be done, was to take a mild-mannered interrogator, simple hunger and turn a sandwich into a sadistic exercise.( of season 4 are awesome, the andorian/aenar arc was fairly awesome. the situation where the rumblings of the birth of the federation were excellent and i will even say that parts of the arc for terra-prime were really good, but i cannot agree with you as to how they treated the main characters. it was pretty clear that they meant to do violence to the series and show 1/2 way through the final season of the series and simply started being semi-sadistic to viewers and characters - as well as (if we are to believe as informed) the actors themselves.",1
1992,it would be interesting to see the distribution of these responses by age of the respondents.,1
1993,well.. picard beat out the animated series at least lol.,1
1994,"i feel that many sci fi shows focus too much on interpersonal tensions in lieu of better stories that focus on the uniqueness of the shows' setting, to the point that i just think ""here we go again, opportunities are being squandered"" when it happens.",1

1996,star trek: the original series,1
1998,"i really didn't care for enterprise, personally. entirely subjective, but it had by far the weakest ~~cast~~ crew to me. most were just forgettable, and i've never had any desire to go back and rewatch it.",1
1999,"so, i agree the orville ""gets"" trek way better than discovery or picard, but is it really your absolute favorite?",1
2000,"its...not though.  i dont want to be one of those fans that puts down other peoples opinions and you are 100% allowed to like whatever you wantbut disco is just abysmal and low brow.  we went from thoughtful plots (inner light, measure of a man) to ""tee hee, i like science""we went from exciting plots (siege of ar556, in the pale moonlight) to strobe light action that tries to pack a physically uncomfortable amount of explosions into one shot.it's just surface sci fi, full of tropes, with only twists and no plot.",1

2002,picard was apparently made by people who hate star trek. discovery was apparently made by people who only heard of it.,1
2003,"yeah, i was in high school when voyager started.i figured out how bad it was rather quick. i was actually very excited for the premier, but by half way through the first season i'd given up. i didn't go through the entire show until maybe my late 20s or early 30s.",1
2004,james blish called it pantropy.,1
2005,"on the one hand, totally fair, they were both so excellent. on the other hand, there would never have been a ds9 without tng first, so it will always get my vote. plus, picard. so.",1
2006,it was better when i was young and not as critical of shows xd still has great episodes though.,1
2007,"having grown up with tos means that my definition of what ""star trek is"" has that as its primary reference... and nothing does tos better than tos. tng and ds9 are very good series... and probably ""better"" in some kind of abstract level of theatrical quality... and i like them tons... but they just aren't as much ""star trek"" to me.",1
2008,"that ""waiting"" and the feedback and re-briefing once the ""just waiting"" is over, is (design) work as well. peiple way to often think of drawing first, when they hear the word ""design"". design is a theoretical dicipline first, the visual part follows.",1
2009,look up the norby chronicles! i think there are 11 of them,1
2010,she might like the franny k. stein series by jim benton.,1
2011,"i am not a mcfarlane fan and assumed the orville would be ""dick jokes in space"". i ended up watching it after it being recommended by some people i trust. while it does have comedy in it, it's not a parody of tng but very much a love letter, similar to galaxy quest.the first couple episodes of the first season were rough, and you can tell he sold it to the network as ""family guy in space"" but after about 3-4 episodes it's like he met the networks mandated quota of dick jokes and made the show a serious tng clone with some comedy elements. i watch both it and discovery (haven't seen picard yet) but i consider the orville much more ""trek-like"" then discovery.",1
2012,"i feel like enterprise gets underrated because by the time it came out people were burned out on star trek. it also didn’t help that it got canceled just as it was hitting it’s stride. people tend to forget that basically all star trek shows start out rough, and only get good by their 3rd season or so. id argue that season 3 and 4 of enterprise are as good or better than any other season of star trek.",1
2013,"i so wanted to love discovery but couldn’t connect to it. discovery was ok sci-fi but it missed the feel of the star trek brand. same with picard. part of the appeal of the other series’ was that the crew was a family and had familial bonds despite everything going on around them. part of the drama came from those loyalties being tested. it felt like disco and picard never formed real ‘crews’. it seemed more to be about the individual in conflict with starfleet/the federation. that’s always been more of a starwars theme. the writers and production crew want gritty realism but i suspect that the viewers want a sense of community, optimism and a sense of common good.  the modern movies did a good job of maintaining that ideal but i wonder if disco was too morally ambivalent?",1
2014,you gotta power through the first season and a half.,1
2015,"well, he eventually became a smaller part.  and whether his acting was decent is another matter.  i just hated both characters.  they are the reason i didnt watch the show regularly.",1
2016,there's also !the guy who falls in love with the ship's ai and likes to curl up naked next to the warm computer core.!< might be confuzzling.,1
2017,"star trek discovery features such contemplative dialogue as ""i like science"" and ""this is the power of math!""st picard features such optimistic and hopeful dialogue as ""shut the fuck up"" and ""i should just put a phasers in my mouth and get it over with""that should tell you all you need to know about each series",1
2018,the expanse is a really good scifi tv series. based on a book series but i haven’t read them. it reminds me of mass effect aesthetically at times.,1
2021,"bringing some love for voyager. i loved the characters and the pacing and i loved the sci-fi. the ship was great. it felt like an evolution of the older ships instead of like ""here we are with the same technology,"" especially as they integrated borg tech, etc. i liked that being in a totally different part of the galaxy meant so many new species, places, etc, and without the safety net of the federation. basically loved the whole series except the chakotay boxing episode and the way they handled the concept of a ""queen"" borg. the borg were fun and interesting and scary and alien because they were a very different kind of intelligence as a collective. seven is fascinating because she lets us think about what it means to be a part of an intelligence/community/etc like that and then to lose it. but the queen sort of reduces all that.",1
2022,he is not a fanboy.,1
2023,amen. that thing about world scale is so in contrast with the original.,1
2024,"ent seasons 1-3 are bad.season 4 is the single best season of star trek to me, just slightly above the late seasons of ds9 because while the best episodes of ds9 are still better, s4 of ent is so consistently good.",1
2025,you seem like a miserable shit. this is clearly not an ad.,1
2026,that sounds incredible! and it would give such credibility to that episode where seven downloads too much data into her brain and starts spitting conspiracy theories like she's alex jones.if only . . .,1

2029,"voyager then tng then ds9 for me, discovery and picard are good but they have some way to go yet. the original series is also good in it's own quirky sort of way. i think i've watched the whole of voyager 3 times and yes i can also point out it's flaws but i enjoyed it regardless.",1
2030,"i have no idea what i just read but 'mission accomplished', i totally want to see clara now just to see what the hell inspired that enthusiastic word porridge.",1
2031,"i was shocked how much i loved the orville. they managed to capture the spirit of star trek better than anything since voyager, imo.",1
2033,second the orville. needs to be on this straw poll. it’s doing what discovery should have done. my god bortus’s holodeck episode ‘primal urges’ was golden. it’s just a shame they get so bogged down in kelly and ed’s ‘relationship’ drama. not even troy and riker were that bad.,1
2034,"they never got rid of neelix, and ethan phillips's acting carried a good chunk of the show.",1
2035,"i liked it, but i got tired of some aspects of the show. it's bigger, faster, and actiony-er, etc.",1
2036,"yeah. i liked dsc but it felt like a chore. i haven't seen picard, and i'm not paying for that service. i was truly worried what mcfarlane would do with the orville, but it seems like a love letter to trek.""star trek, but they're human beings"" has been great. it's the first time i've been excited about a new episode since watching ent as an adolescent.",1

2040,you seem to like harassing people on reddit.  why is that?,1
2041,"david drake's ""rcn series"" has some skullduggery in it. it's intended to be a starfaring riff on the aubrey-maturin series set in the age of sail. (the starships even use sails. it sounds gimmicky but it makes from some unique tactics and difficulties in combat.) one of the two main characters, the librarian adele mundy, is a spy who tags along on navy missions under the guise of being captain daniel leary's signals officer.",1
2043,everyone assumes if i don’t like discovery or picard or new trek movies it’s because i’m nostalgic for the old.  maybe.  or maybe it’s because it’s star trek in name only and otherwise sucks?   hmmmmm.,1
2044,try r/whatsthatbook if no one remembers here :),1
2045,"mabye give discovery or picard a few episodes but at least in my opinion i don't think they are worth it so far. certainly not if philosophical questions are what you liked about tng/previous shows.the new shows are rather dumbed down and more focused on action. they are also way darker and lack the optimistic feeling, not to mention they are completely serialized.",1
2046,"it's probably because access to star trek: discovery is limited by the cost.  i would venture that many people, myself included, aren't going to pay $30 for a single season or don't want to subscribe to yet another platform (cbs).",1
2047,sometimes i have to flip a mental coin.,1
2048,"dune is amazing.  it's my favorite and most read fiction book after hitchhiker's guide.dune is fantastic for many reasons, but i'm gonna focus on the two main aspects i love.first, the world building is some of the best that's ever occurred.  herbert cared more about the world of arrakis than he did about the story being told.  and this really comes through.  even if i didn't care about paul or the harkonnens, i still feel like i've visited arrakis and spent a good part of my life there.  everything is fleshed out, from the people to the culture to the religion.  and there are so many points that are barely made in passing that make the world so rich.  why do you need mentats?  because thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human brain - due to the butlerian jihad.  what was that?  the book doesn't directly tell you, you have to infer that there was some robot uprising thousands of years ago that is still shaping this culture.second, the book is perhaps the best modern example of old story telling.  from the greeks to shakespeare, stories were often spoiled at the very beginning.  a play would begin with a five minute miming of the major points.  people didn't care about twists or turns.  they wanted to see good execution.anyways, dune is like that, except you don't realize it at first.  everything in dune is not only foreshadowed, it is blatantly foreshadowed in almost exact ways.  you are told the ending in the first few chapters of the book.  but you fight it, you fight the certainty, you fight the spoiler, just like paul constantly fights against his visions of the permanent jihad.  you are given the foresight that the kwisatz haderach is given and you fight against it the same as he does.  it was on my third read through that i was able to spot every spoiler and see just how blatant and obvious it is.  but, because of how the book is written, the obviousness is hidden from the casual reader.the world and the way the story is told is even better than the story and its characters.&#x200b;edit:  i wanted to add something else that's really cool.  while dune is set in a completely foreign universe, so many of the stories are real historical stories from the caucus mountains.  if you read sabres of paradise you will see so many real life examples that herbert seamlessly integrated.",1
2049,"any reason to watch some of the newer shows? my favorite part of tng is the moral quandaries that they “solve” in the course of an episode, and i’ve found that whatever show nowadays don’t seem to care about philosophical questions at all.",1
2050,"yeah, i consider both part of the core concept & both fit the bill of being tossed out the window & driven over repeatedly. they where completly isolated from starfleet & the rest of the federation, but still magically the ship was always fine & they where fully stocked on weapons, etc. the only time they struggled was in lip service to a plot hole.the plots should have centered on the ship falling apart & them having no friends, instead it was 99% tng light, 1% lost in space.",1

2081,"ah; i get where you are coming from a bit more.yeah; that's from disco, i assumed that was what you were thinking about as it's really the only example of a gay relationship in trek i could think of. it's pretty good in my book, the relationship (not their sexuality) is important to the characters and informs their responses and emotions, but is not the focus of the episodes/show at any point.i would argue it is less that people have moved away from sublety and more that writing relationships is hard and people have always written a lot of bad stuff. the move to shorter seasons exacerbates this bc it's even harder to write convincing romance when you have 8-12 episodes to do it instead of 20. i don't feel the need to push the envelope on acceptance, i let people freely make up their own minds, even in their attitudes about race.this is the only issue i have with your thinking. people are regularly murdered and harrassed due to their race, gender, religion, and sexuality. it is very clear that you live in an area or are of a group that doesn't have these issues in the forefront of public life, but for a lot of people, constant vigilance and awareness is a survival skill.there is a place for fun blow stuff up sci fi, but star trek has built a legacy of arguing against the kind of complacency that allows us to say that the kkk, nationalist hate groups, and other hateful people are ""someone else's problem"". star trek has always been explicitly political and should remain so. our entertainment serves to normalize and encourage thinking, regardless of whether there is an intended message, dismissal of this does not change that fact.we may have to part in continued disagreement, but i urge you to consider that if you choose to ""let people make up their minds"" you are not being impartial, you are explicitly declaring that you like things the way they are. that is a political position, whether you intend it to be or not.""vigilance, mr. worf. that is the price we continually have to continually pay.""it applies to all social progress as much as to rascism and mccarthyism.",1

2127,"legend of the galactic heroes: die neue these (anime) is pretty great imo, and is kind of ongoing. there's an older complete version available as well (legend of the galactic heroes), but it's not available with and english dub (my personal preference), and it's fairly old, so the animation style is quite dated, that being said it's one of the most highly regarded anime out there, so i would also put it out there for your consideration.star blazers or space battleship yamato 2199/2202 is another anime rebooted series that's pretty good and still ongoing.knights of sidonia (anime) is another one i'd recommend. some people don't like the cgi animation style, but polygon pictures did this one, and i tend to find their animation style, works pretty well with their general art aesthetic. i'd also toss out a recommendation for the movie blame!, which actually gets referenced in kos, and is by the same studio.i'd also highly recommend the halo franchise. by which i mean, not just the games, but also the books, and possibly even some of the comics. i originally played all of the campaigns (up through halo 4), and enjoyed them, but always thought they seemed a bit shallow, like there was a lot more going on, but just brushed it off as lazy writing for games that were more focused on multiplayer. then i started playing 5 and was like what the hell? there are other spartan iis running around?. so, i looked up what was going on and realized there's a whole set of books and comics that delve into the going ons of the halo universe and they're all canon. so, i started cranking through the books (i went with the audiobook route) and was kinda amazed at how much more fleshed out the whole universe was, and how the stories from the game made waaay more sense and had much more depth to them. so, if you're interested in playing the campaigns, or already have, i'd at least recommend reading the main storyline books (fall of reach, the flood (which is basically the halo 1 campaign in story form, with the added bonus of knowing what the hell everybody else is doing while master chief is running around kicking ass), first strike, and ghosts of onyx, will take you through the halo 3 campaign), but i'd really recommend almost all of them, including the anthologies, as well as the movies/miniseries/anime and halo wars games, since they also contain some great stories that shed some light on what's going on both during and in between the games, and add/explain a lot of the in-universe lore. i'd also like to add here that the halo books have some of my favorite space battles in sci-fi, particularly in the first book, the fall of reach.i'd also be remiss if i didn't give a shout out to battlestar galactica, a quintessential space opera. as well as the expanse.there's also a whole host of other shows that scratch my personal sci-fi itch, without maybe being quite as epic, like the stargate franchise, dark matter, killjoys, falling skies, and defiance. but, i think based on your list they might be a little smaller in scale (except for some of the later stargate stuff).",1

2244,"i guess from op's perspective, everyone and their mother has ripped off dune. star wars, 40k, the list goes on. it's like john carter of mars. it seemed so cliche because it came first and everyone ripped it off, so when the movie was made people felt they had seen it all before.",1

2247,the story in herbert's dune will seem dated? i'm not tracking here at all. why would you think this?,1
2248,i think it’s definitely possible. he wrote so many short stories and novellas so quickly that it’d be nearly impossible to come up with an entirely new and different world for each one. not sure if it’s intentional or not though.,1
2249,"i just googled it bc i thought it was a tv series. apparently there's both a movie and companion tv series slated, with the movie being a 2-parter, and the series focusing on the bene gesserit. two movies for the first book alone seems like it could work ok, if they paced it right - that would probably be about 4-5 hours of content.",1
2250,picard is pretty great.  worth a binge.,1
2251,can we just talk about star wars for once!?!?!?,1
2252,i mean tv. as in 10 episodes at 1 hour each. there’s too much to cram into a movie.,1

2263,"the only problem i have with this is that in my experience it's always a director coming out swinging... telling us about how long they spent perfecting a visual only for say...the script...to be so lacking it drags down the whole film. for me that's been my experience with legendary as a studio. first i had gdt absolutely putting his heart and soul into creating each individual monster and robot...only to have that script be laughably bad. then the 2014 godzilla has gareth edwards talking about spending a solid year with weta workshop on the design of that good chonky boy. and then the movie comes out and that script had been ripped apart and stitched together so many times it was barely still holding on. i have a lot of trust in denis, especially because his track record is damn near impeccable...but i worry.",1

2266,that's the thing with dune; what might be considered a minor detail turns out to be important.jms did the same thing with babylon 5. you could have a throwaway line of dialogue in season 1 that is amazingly important to an event in season 3...,1

2276,its so cringe to think about. alien species who were the last of their species and had watched all their friends and family die or be assimilated as their cultures were destroyed were probably much sadder than one romulan....,1

2288,"he does not have a light touch. these shows are investments of between $50-$100 mill a series. kurtzman will be all over it unfortunately, he is a pox on star trek",1

2293,"no, it would take a year or more with the director. kubrick on average spent two years picking out the music for his movies with his people, so a year on sandworm design makes perfect sense. concept art, final renders, camera tests, vfx camera tests, practical or digital, it's gonna' take a good amount of time because i'm pretty sure villeneuve's not feeling the sandworms from '84.",1

2297,seen ‘em all numerous times thanks.,1
2298,"read the novella ""diamond dogs"" by alistair reynolds. it hits that nail on the head and is a small story set a really interesting and expansive universe. basically in this story there is an alien spire that floats 6 feet above an abandoned moon far away from where most of civilization is in the galaxy. it has a series of rooms that have puzzles of ever increasing complexity. those puzzles are inscribed around doors that get smaller ever so slightly through each room. i don't want to ruin anything but between the spire and its extraterrestrial fucked up nature and the way the characters need to modify/mutilate their bodies to handle the inhuman complexity of the puzzles and fit through doors that are too small for all their old bones is grieger and biomechanical as best i can imagine in writing.this is set in reynolds ""revelation space"" anthology. it has stories ranging from 300 to 40 billion years from now. a few of the cultures and characters from that world hit the grieger biomechanical vibe.",1
2299,"a great story, watched it again recently. thanks.",1

2329,i liked it!,1
2330,"yeah, you are probably right. personally i would like to have the time back that i put into those books. i honestly should have stopped when i did like the first book. i can't imagine someone putting this series on the same level as the greatest series of high fantasy.",1
2331,"all the things mentioned above, as well as i'd find a different font. the color gradations are fun, but should be intentional in the palette for each scene. which it largely is. the different styles of illustration is slightly jarring. i think the vertical spacing is fine.",1
2332,i got a good laugh from your comment. when you put it that way it sounds pretty bad. i had deal with a friend that when she got to the brandon sanderson books that wrap up the wheel of time that i would re-read them. i've done the whole series before and i thought this would be fun. i ended up believing that the last 3 books stand by themselves pretty well.there is something special about the way sanderson writes matrim cauthon.,1
2333,seems like we are in the new age of media.  something like this would make an excellent mini series.  it is too much to wedge into a 2 hour movie.  i love how he made vampires cool and scary again.  also really scratches that hard sci fi itch like no other i've found.,1
2334,"i read the first in both languages (a localized taiwanese edition). it's a pretty good translation, in my opinion. the chinese suffers from the same issues as the english translation, namely that people love it or hate it. the sci has the same ideas, but the fi in chinese is similarly bad (imo) as it is in english: unnatural dialogue, poor character development, etc.",1
2335,i know. most funny books you sit there going “heh heh” or laughing in your head. but this series literally brings tears to the eyes and has to be put down from time to time because you just can’t physically read it.,1
2336,i’m going to read it based solely off your recommendation!,1
2337,its not good. the format is all over the place. so is the grammar.,1
2338,not done that one yet...  will check it out. thanks.,1
2339,you have to be realistic about these things?,1
2340,this was a pretty good watch.solid analysis all around.,1
2341,"i haven’t looked for any of them as audiobooks. i would love to see the may books as a lotr-style set of movies, but they would have to keep to the books.",1
2342,"the follow up ""best served cold"" has a kickass female lead.",1
2343,"i'm an old fart, try thomas covenant and the gap cycle by stephen donaldson for sci fi, elric by michael moorcock for fantasy, authors you should check out are david brin and gregory benford, and don't forget terry pratchett's discworld",1
2344,yes they were...i really enjoyed that series.,1
2345,i would recommend the hyperion cantos by dan simmons. one of the best series i've ever read with very similar vocabulary to dune. another is a small series called star force by b.v. larson. rama by arthur c. clarke another classic.,1
2346,pushing ice by alastair reynolds,1
2347,i haven't read it in a while now but i likedthe fionavar tapestry by guy gavriel kay,1
2348,"the scrolling format is a really great tool you've used to help increase suspense in the comic. however, the separation of the text bubbles from the graphics really takes away from the experience rather than enhancing it. it looks like you did that to help pace the story a little bit, which is extremely clever.i've always loved bermuda lore so that was a fun experience. again get a little help with the native speaking like the other comments have stated and you will be well well on your way forward.",1
2349,"sure, just like you can read about the scouring of the shire as one compact story, with a big-ass prequel.",1
2350,"i don't think anyone cares about flirting at all. i'm referring to the really clumsy statements and storylines that focus on their sexuality. as long as there is discrimination and inequality i think its important we have representation in media for everyone to identify with but not everything has to be a statement. it's much more compelling to have a strong female lead completely comfortable with who she is and the story focuses on the normal things that character encounters. i think supergirl does this with dreamer who is trans, a lot better. she's just a person and there's no contrived statements or catchphrases just because she is transgender.edit: spelling",1
2351,are you sure it's just that you don't notice it when a straight lead flirts with a character of the opposite gender? :),1
2352,"not offended at all. not everything has to be made for my tastes. i do avoid shows that throw it in your face in really clumsy ways. take batwoman for example on cw, the main character is a lesbian which is fine except they make a point of having that be 90% of her identity and in the foreground all the time so instead of a powerful female icon who happens to like girls it lacks subtlety and she comes across as a very two dimensional character with lesbian catch phrases.shows with hetero leads don't make the story about their sexuality, it just is - and i get that hetero relationships have had the luxury of ""just being""-  and in that way its more organic and flows better. so my view is that many lgbtq content makers undermine how many audiences they could reach by falling into this trap of ironically filling their writing with exclusionary statements at the cost of story.",1
2353,"i mean he doesn't owe us anything, but he did lie to us so yeah i'm a bit peeved.",1
2354,second one was my favorite!,1
2355,"no clear answer though rothfuss has included included inability to focus while trump is in office among his reasons. personally, i think it would be difficult to experience everything he alluded to in the first book, but failed to include in the second book, in one tidy third book",1
2357,"on the baxter side of things, i thought that he had a book (or three) that addressed the time dilation that occurred through portal travel. specifically, mankind discovers portals that connect us to other parts of the universe, but they effectively function like transporters-- you get beamed between portals at the speed of light, and assembled on the other end. portal is 10 light years away? it takes 10 years to get there.certain people get employed as couriers to move between the portals, and initially, it's considered a very lucrative job. you spend a few months in space, then 20 years travelling between portals, and when you're finally back home, compound interest has made you rich. but society eventually turns against these people, who return home to find they're broke and all their friends are dead or aged significantly.i would have sworn this was part of the manifold series, but re-reading the descriptions, it doesn't seem like them.this ring a bell to anyone?edit: maybe manifold: space?

2358,it’s already blurbsuday in dimension c-42,1
2359,"i really liked ""the prince of nothing"" series by r. scott bakker. combination of religious war/magic/ ancient ""aliens"". very enjoyable ride. the main character is inspiring and detestable.",1
2361,true. the reason i said that it only touched on it was that it was very much about the individual perspective about that not so much the society which seemed to be what op was asking about.,1
2362,book of the new sun was amazing.,1
2363,why no third on kingkiller?,1
2364,michael moorcock’s eternal champion saga is pretty damn epic and stretches over many novels.    the chronology is complicated but i would just pick up elric of melniboné for starters.,1
2365,one of the best conceived systems of magic in any fantasy series imo,1
2366,"just by way of clarification, forever war is very specifically about the time dilation that occurs from near lightspeed travel. soldiers get sent off to fight a battle light-years away, age for a few years in their own time frame, but return decades after they left. as they get sent on missions farther and farther away, the effects become even greater.it's really amazing on a number of fronts, and i'm annoyed at myself that i only read it for the first time in the last couple of years.",1
2367,this. just now. really had a hard time convincing myself to finish. it became tedious and pulpy with cycle after cycle of the same developments. the twist wasn’t compelling at all by the time it came. i just didn’t care anymore. dystopia is hard that way,1
2368,"king killer chronicles is fantastic imo, awaiting the third book. i'm 1/2 through the second book in the dune series and it is much slower than kkc",1
2369,"i think lena let herself be destroyed in the end, and she was replaced with the loyal wife. her self destructive tendencies were related to her marriage and infedility, and her husband was self-destructive because he loved her and knew she was cheating. the two replacements are happy together for real, not like the originals who were just pretending.that's the creepiest thing about how people die in the movie. when they die, they're happy because they found exactly what they were looking for. well except for the bear victims i guess.",1
2370,good! you're not a jerk like these guys who are hideously offended by the mere existence of genre fiction that doesn't center their straight cis white male experience. <3,1
2371,"the expanse focuses on exactly this transition, its impact on the existing civilization, and resulting politics.lots of cj cherryh alliance-union universe talks about this transition, with a multi-system stl civilization transitioning to ftl.  in most of these, it's covered in the prologue as historical context, but she's just started a trilogy (hinder stars) set during the transition itself.",1
2372,second that vote on amber chronicles. it's a sprawling adventure across many different realities with political/royal intrigue tying it all together.  i believe it was one of the (no doubt many) stories that influenced grrm and song of ice and fire.,1
2373,"michael j sullivan's riyria books are amazing as well.  i listened to these on audible and had trouble stopping to go to sleep, work, etc.",1
2374,the movies ibe seen 9n there i'd recommend are: ex machinathe man from earth a boy and his dogmoonall have some redeeming qualities. otherwise beware the uber terrible movie landmines.,1
2375,"if you haven't read pratchett's discoworld books i recommend them to everyone.  they're fantasy with a farcical/humorous bent.  some of the best books i've ever read.david eddings belgariad and mallorean books.  really engaging epic fantasy... i don't know why i never see them mentioned.  the mallorean is a bit of a rehash of the belgariad to be honest but still a good read.another vote for tad williams memory, thorn and sorrow series.",1
2376,he's extremely homophobic and just an all around bigot.,1
2377,where's the review? i get two paragraphs of introduction… then nothing.,1
2378,read dune. skip the intergalactic political garbage.,1
2379,good review! if you're looking for more of the same vibes i recommend good omens (by the same author and neil gaiman) and the magic 2.0 series!,1
2380,great books.  never seem to see them recommended.,1
2381,i would strongly recommend getting into the malazan book of the fallen series. incredible characters and insane world building.,1
2383,why's he a jackass?,1
2384,we should probably let him be the judge of that?,1
2385,forever war is my absolute favourite book.op read it just because it's amazing.,1
2386,i am loving the last kingdom book series right now (the saxon chronicles by bernard cromwell). last time i stayed up reading so late was abercrombie’s book 3 of the first law trilogy (the last argument of kong’s).,1
2387,surely in scifi there have to be made up names when the setting isn't earth or the characters aren't descended from earth.  i think there's actually a real skill to making up names but i have given up on books where the author was bad at it.,1
2388,"the kingkiller chronicles essentially goes nowhere for two books (and is especially glacial in the second).people pour lavish undue praise on his writing. the prologue is one overlong empty metaphor. and there are points where he leans heavy on adverbs (in fact, he uses the same adverb in the same way at least four or five times on one page).the main character doesn't have many flaws, and when he does make a mistake, the consequences don't have much bearing. the second book devolves into an extended sex fantasy where the author describes the sex using a naming system rather than actually painting a picture (a thousand hands is a paraphrased example).he does good work with the metafictional aspects, and the construction of sympathy as a magic system is intriguing, but all that falls flat when faced with a plot that doesn't know where its going and a story that is populated with wooden characters.",1
2389,the orvillefuturama,1
2390,"chat bubbles not overlayed on the images bothers me, i feel disconnected from the story, with my brain switching from image to text, to image to text, instead of comprehending it all as one. small point, the sail on the boat are very far from normal, maybe check out some images of them and work in proper sails.otherwise, your art style, colour choice, and gradients are all appealing.",1
2391,"one i haven't seen mentioned that is one of my favorites is the chronicles of thomas covenant. 2 trilogies and a 3rd set of 4 for a total of 10 books. now i will have to say you will probably either love it or hate it, there is little in between. the main character is more of an antihero. you sympathize with him but at times he is just so horrible a person he is hard to love. that is because of the heaping misery that he has gone through in his lifetime. really interesting and different stories. haven't seen anything else quite like them.hail the white gold wielder, the half-hand, wild magic wielder.",1
2392,except that people and minds can and do leave all the time when they decide that mainstream culture isn't for them.,1

2394,"it's not science fantasy per se, but anathem by neal stephenson is a really rich story in an original world. it's actually reminiscent of dune in that it kinda drops you into a complicated world with little context and lets you figure it out. seveneves is near future sci-fi but incredibly good. stephenson in general is a fantastically talented author. also more traditional sci-fi, but the three body problem is a great book that starts an excellent trilogy. fairly philosophical, but lots of interesting mythology, history, and technology as well. its one of my favorite books i've read in years. stephen king's the dark tower is an often bizarre, but extremely creative and interesting, series. science-fantasy-western. it's not going to be for everyone but i liked it a lot. i'll reiterate the culture series too",1
2395,"as much as i hate to recommend his books because he's a jackass orson scott card's ""the ender quintet"" books deal significantly with how ftl travel affects things like warfare. society, that sort of thing.",1
2396,"i agree. i read the series in middle school, so i don't remember a lot of details, but i can still clearly remember the pure vindication i felt when the statue of the bad guy (honestly can't remember his name, ""darkhan"" something?) came down.",1

2398,kingkiller is excellent!,1

2400,"“cast under an alien sun” and the rest of the “destiny’s crucible” series are great and don’t get as much recognition as i think they deserve. they’ve got wonderfully detailed world building and are a really interesting. they’re not what i’d normally think of when i hear the words “science fantasy”, sort of the opposite really. instead of being a future world with fantasy elements, they’re more a premodern world with science elements. it’s a really cool look at the idea of “ what if someone with modern knowledge was sent back in time.” except instead of being sent back in time they’re sent to another planet full of pre-modern cultures. if you’re looking for something a bit more epic in scope i’d suggest red rising as others have. another deities that deserves more attention than it gets.",1
2401,"love it. like others said, maybe have a native speaker to clean up some of the text.  the art is cool and i like the scrolling style. so cool.  thank you for sharing!!",1
2402,"characters are a problem in malazan.  there are just too many.  erikson did not handle them as well as jordan.  it was very hard to 'connect' with any.  to make matters worse, most were mopey (god damn udinaas, man up!), the world was huge yet barren, and every other character also happened to be 300,000+ years old ubergod, but was too depressed to actually use their powers.",1
2403,"book of the new sun was good, but intense. i probably need to re-read it. fifth head of cerberus was more accessible.",1
2404,i know it old but check out david eddings the belgarid..  prince of thorns by mark lawrence is a solid trilogy as well,1
2405,"if you're a fan of the forests of vancouver... whoa, boy!",1
2406,the good stuf starts after the first book.,1

2408,"i tried gardens of the moon. i was really excited about it, actually.i gave up about halfway through. i listened via audible.the problems i had getting into the story:- constant point of view and plot jumping. i think every chapter - and even multiple times in the same chapter - switches perspectives and even plots. i was frustrated because i wanted to build some kind of attachment or understanding of the characters but kept jumping away from them as soon as i got to know them.- the audible narrators voice for krappa. i think this made me quit more than anything. it seemed so intentionally obnoxious and annoying... i don’t understand why they used that voice and tone...",1
2409,yes! great world building and a volume of work that will keep someone busy for a while! don’t sleep on the side series either- especially the janny wurts trilogy like other commenters said.,1
2410,expeditionary force by whom?,1
2411,stargate franchise,1
2412,they are very good!,1
2413,i think it most likely that she is the original lena just changed by the shimmer.or less likely but possible that the original lena died soon after entering the shimmer and the one that wakes up is a copy.,1
2414,"i had a hard time dealing with how the narrator says ""grimaced"". but other than that, good narrator!",1
2415,there is a 2nd short story by patrick rothfuss called the lightning tree.,1
2416,"loved the scrolling style. the text bubbles like ""storm begun"" seemed clunky, not sleek. also, grammatical errors take me out of it. would love to see less black backgrounds like the ""storm begun"" one, would much rather the scrolling nature of the comic flow so as to never break suspension of belief.other than that, fun read, cool twist. your style is nascent and coming to life. love it!",1
2417,meaby not exactly the thing you asked for but nausicaa is highly inspired by work of french comics artist moebius. his series arzach was main inspiration. i think miyazaki teakes composition and sense of space also from other moebius work. he also created amazing short comic called ballad it uses poems arthur rimbaud as text. i write about that one couse its beatiful and has this fantasy-alien fauna in it.,1
2418,hope you did book 2! it's even better that the first book!,1
2419,"king killer chronicles is a 200% definitely read asap recommendation. also, wheel of time is a requirement. brandon sanderson actually finished the last 3 books after robert jordan passed away.",1
2420,on mobile and haven’t read all the comments. tad williams has the dragonbone chair series and war of the flowers. i hope you see this and enjoy them.,1
2421,if you want something that is on the level of greatness you need to read the kingkiller chronicle books. you would still have read dune if there were no sequels. patrick rothfuss writes like a god on earth.,1
2422,"i don't discriminate against trans people at all. to me they are just like any kind of writer and if her gender identity motivates what she writes fine, maybe it's not for everyone. just like chicks probably wouldn't enjoy content written by men who feel the need to make everything about their views as a male.",1
2423,i re-read the the kingkiller chronicle books over and over like i do with no other series. the beautiful way patrick rothfuss uses words is second to no one. he is the master. time will tell this to be true.,1
2424,"i have read the entire series twice with the exception of the brian herbert house books. for me, i loved the atmosphere and the universe that inhabits these books",1
2425,"these may have already been listed, but in the order of just how gripping i have found them:the masquerade series (currently 2 books, with the third of four coming out in a few months)  - the traitor baru cormorant and the monster baru cormorant, by seth dickinson. i read the original dune sextet over the summer before my freshman year of high school and nothing i have read since then has ever been as compelling...until this. i generally don't cry over books, either, but i openly wept at multiple points reading them. i'm not sure how to describe them - whether as fantasy, sci-fi, steam/diesel/other-punk, historical fiction or what - but the series takes place in a mostly realistic not-earth world and follows the namesake protagonist as she grapples with the legacies of progress, imperialism, colonialism, power, intelligence and truth.  truly, i wept over these books.after the masquerade, i would recommend the following series by gene wolfe: the book of the new sun and its immediate follow-on work, the urth of the new sun. these are the opening salvo of a multi-series arc in a shared milieu. they're followed by the book of the long sun (a tetralogy) and the book of the short sun (a trilogy). in total, there are 12 books in this series. while the stories didn't make me literally weep, they're the most exquisitely written science fiction that i have ever encountered in the english language (and some of the best english language writing i've encountered, period). and the stories are gripping.next, i would point you equally at anything by china miéville or iain m banks. as for mr. miéville, i'm particularly fond of the scar (part of his bas-lag universe, along with perdido street station and iron council) and the stand-alone works kraken and the city and the city (the last being also more of a realistic fiction than pure science fiction). regarding mr. banks, i'm presently reading through consider phlebas, the first book (in order of release date) in his culture milieu; i finished the hydrogen sonata (the last book to be released before his death) in about a week and a half at the start of quarantine. i have 5 more of his books queued up at present (excession is next on my list). as an aside, had i stumbled into mr. bank's books instead of dune, i am not sure precisely how my life (interior and exterior) would be different than today, but i know it would be radically so.finally, i also have to give extensive props to runners up greg bear (check out the duologies composed of queen of angels and / pronounced slant, and the forge of god and the anvil of stars), greg egan (his works are abstruse and technical, yet mindblowing and, even if you don't have a good grasp of the math, are entirely readable), and a special favorite of mine that no one seems to have heard of - patricia anthony, who wrote a bunch of great sci-fi novels in the late 90's and early 00's, of which god's fires (which is about how a village in inquisition era portugal deals with a crashed alien spacecraft and its occupants) is my personal favorite.&#x200b;edit - wow, sorry, i somehow misread your post going from phone to desktop. i'll have to check out what you're looking at on your queue. i've never heard of them, but i always have room in my library. i'm leaving this up though because it took a long time to type, lol.",1
2426,"it's probably one of my favorite book series, as a love of sci-fi and fiction. it's not crazy complicated, it's not revolutionary in any way... it's just damned good. as someone described it above, it's as if tarantino decided to write a somewhat grounded fantasy novel.",1
2427,definitely not on the same level that op is looking for.,1
2428,it's okay to just read the last 3 books of the wheel of time. a perfect compact trilogy. then you can just think of the robert jordan books as a prequel.,1
2429,great trilogy. you won't be disappointed.,1
2430,"don’t get me wrong i love them all. i’ve never heard it considered the worst, for example on goodreads it’s pretty close to the ranking of the first three and higher than prelude. i just loved the epic scale of it and i thought the ending was really satisfying, but each to their own of course!",1
2431,since you like scifi...  have you read asimov's foundation trilogy?,1

2445,"the three body problem certainly addresses the big societal changes of a single technologically-driven moment: first contact. it doesn’t explicitly address ftl in a “warp drive” or “wormhole” fashion, but does deeply consider factors like the dimensional out of the universe (at least in the later books).",1
2446,"if you're interested, there are also some cool fiction podcasts in this genre!",1
2447,i like the idea. it's a nice twist. i also enjoy the scrolling style for readingi do think that the story telling is clumsy. in english at least the phrases used are odd. you may want to work with a native speaker to rework some of it. also some of the pacing feels odd. i would use this as a first draft and keep working on it. good luck.,1
2448,oof buddy you should’ve known you were gonna get downvoted for calling firefly a waste of time,1

2451,"vance appears to be a bit out of fashion now. i can sort of see why: his cultures are viewed from an outsider's perspective and he often shows conservative and highly structured societies as comfortable. both of which aren't in tune with the thoughts of the good and the great at the moment. it's a pity; his colours, tastes, smells and loquaciousness are unique.",1

2459,"don’t read patrick rothfuss yet.  only similarity to george rr martin is he’s taken 49999 years to come out with the newest book. i recommend:- steven erikson- ra salvatore - r. scott bakker- glen cookall told, those are tops in the genre (not the only great ones, but all great).",1

2476,"this prequel makes even less sense than disco...it was rejected by the studio back in the day, for crying out loud! ya'll don't have lucille ball around to save your asses this time!",1
2477,king killer is good but unfinished i read them roughly ten years ago joe abercrombie is great his first law trilogy especially. the wheel of time is very good some say it gets long winded but the world building is spectacular and how it seems to sub genre switch is also good. going from lotr style high fantasy into deep politics and then military fantasy. a lot of stuff by raymond e feist is good magician especially. if you fancy something quick and fun you can’t beat david gemmell. waylander being a personal favourite of mine. if you want something that’s very self aware the belgariad by david eddings is a fun read all the tropes and it knows it. if you like a song of ice and fire the dragon bone chair is also good. i read a lot as a receptionist in my early 20s one two books a week i could go on and on haha,1

2484,"read the expanse or kingkiller chronicles. both are excellent, and imo stand up on subsequent readings.",1
2485,"ok, that makes more sense. just never heard anyone use that term before.",1
2486,"actually, there are ways to get ftl without time travel, but they involve things like breaking the no-preferred-frame assumption in physics. in one of your examples, someone sends an instant message from earth  to proxima centauri, and someone on a spaceship sees the call received before it's sent. but unless the instant message machine also works in their (moving) frame, they can't take advantage of this to send info into the past.anyway, it's an ugly loophole, but it's enough to justify an sf story with ftl but without time travel.",1

2488,"it’s compelling and cool to think about, but the culture isn’t really morally progressive. either the ai are slaves or the humans are pets.",1
2489,“hard” refers to the plausibility mainly of the science of the world. they are usually based or extrapolated from a potential earth future as opposed to something that is more fantastical. in other words the foundation universe could very likely exist where a dune future is unlikely and the entirety of that universe is sprung from  the mind of the creator. hard sci-fi is more based in reality and less in the fantastical.,1
2490,"you mentioned stormlight archives, but if you haven’t read the rest of the cosmere collection by brandon sanderson, that’s a good place to start. if you are more looking for the world building and epic plot, i also recommend james clemens’ wit’ch fire series. it’s kinda dark though. also brent weeks has a couple good series, the night angel trilogy and the lightbringer series. oh and there’s of course the wheel of time series by robert jordan, continued by brandon sanderson, which makes keeping track of characters and their respective plots in ice and fire look easy in comparison.",1

2496,asimov said at one point that his books were closely related to each other but not exact sequels. he would change a few of the details from book to book for the sake of telling a good story. he didn't try to perfectly maintain details across different books for the sake of perfect cannon continuity.,1
2497,"kingkiller books are the best i’ve ever read, but rothfuss and grrm have made it so that i refuse to recommend any unfinished series, so i’ll recommend joe abercrombie’s first law trilogy and his shattered sea trilogy. heck, just read best served cold, the heroes, and red country while you’re at it. awesome stuff.",1
2498,harder than dune? foundation was a walk in the park compared to dune. i had to will myself through heretics and chapterhouse.,1
2499,"the entire ender's game saga by orson scott card. and his homecoming series. those both made a big impact on me as a young adult.gunslinger series by steven kingemberverse by s.m. stirlingkingkiller chronicles are sooooo good, but patrick seems determined not to write the 3rd book, kinda like george rr martin in soiaf.another good one that i can't remember the name of the whole series, but it starts with ""off armageddon reef"" by david webber.",1
2500,he does a great job of giving characters creatives ways to have a niche in how they use their powers. hope you enjoy the series! i've really enjoyed reading it. the author also has some great sci-fi with the four ecolotan books. gravity dreams is probably one of my favorite books by him.,1

2516,"i think it’s because, as an ip, star trek is beyond the point of taking significant creative risks. that’s why in disco the main character is raised by spock’s father, and spock shows up in season 2 because they want to keep reusing the most iconic aspects to make sure people know it’s “star trek.” having it be a prequel is good for them because they don’t have to expend any creative energy creating something even more futuristic and risk the audience rejecting a totally new look and concept. the only reason pic is post voyager is because it’s staring captain picard. they are again, relying on the most iconic aspect of st because new protagonists are a hard sell for them. michael burnham is kind of unlikable. and even pic isn’t rally that innovative or new in the context of mainstream sci-fi or even star trek. tech wise they have more hologram people, but we got that in voy. the digital displays are new for star trek but old to everyone else if you’ve seen the marvel movies. now we’re getting yet another prequel, with more comfortably familiar aspects. it takes place right before tos, has spock, the original tos captain, the original number one, and were back to the colorful tos uniforms.",1

2526,baseless assertions should be backed up or called out.  even in a casual conversation.the general practice and acceptance of spreading disinformation is having a serious negative effect on the world right now.,1
2527,"you could also use that same “hive mind” accusation and apply it to other segments of startrek fandom who say any criticism of modern trek as “hating” and do mental gymnastics to justify poor writing.tos was the first, and caught on big time in syndication and made a big impact on pop culture.tng ended up being very successful during its time. both this show and the original are generally praised by trek fans and critics alike.voy struggled the whole time with ratings and is generally criticized by trek fans and critics to this day.same with ent. it struggled with ratings to point it got cancelled and there was no new trek for years. even now it’s generally viewed as not as good as the first two st incarnations.so maybe it’s not just some fans hating anything that’s new, but maybe many of the shows that have come after just aren’t that good compared to what else is out there. tng has some bad episodes and a weak first two seasons but it was still innovative for its time and there wasn’t many other options for tv sci-fi at the time.now there’s an abundance of sci-fi on television, not to mention the access of classic sci-fi shows available due to streaming, so the landscape is more competitive these days, the standards higher. it’s not doing “nutrek” any favors to compare it to certain episodes/seasons from 30-50 years ago and say, “well those ones were bad too!” as far as the orville goes there’s definitely a few weak episodes in he first season. but overall i personally find the characters to be interesting and very likable. the majority of the individual episodes are great. i also find that this silly star trek-meets-family guy show has more genuine emotional moments than the forced melodrama of pic.",1
2528,i understand your opinion especially with regard to the character development. i did not hate it but found the ideas in it refreshing but ultimately a little hard to follow sometimes. i wish that the reason was do to the translation but ultimately it was probably do to my comprehension. i  never went on to read the others but i might give it a try.,1
2529,"did a quick search in here and it's been mentioned a couple times, but - the dresden files is a fantastic series that i was on the fence about until i started listening to the audio books. incredibly orated. the first two books were not as well paced as i would like, but i forgive it due to the amount of world building they were doing and still having to move the book plot forward. book three onwards are all cemented in my personal ""best of"" fantasy / sci-fi lists.",1

2554,"to me, annihilation is about self destruction and the forms that it can take, and how it changes us. apologies in advance because i'm terrible with names, but here goes-almost everyone that went into the bubble (that lived long enough to be changed by it)  had some self destructive tendencies before going in, workaholics, people that self harm, people that routinely cheat. they all were using something to scratch the itch of being unsatisfied with their life, albeit unsuccessfully.then they get confronted with something that can actually effect real change, on every conceivable level. most of the characters let themselves go completely into the void and willfully let it overtake them (the woman who turned into flowers, the way that the woman seeking knowledge interfaced with the alien right before portman's confrontation at the end) they all embraced the change, and let themselves be fully destroyed by that change. the main character is the only one who isn't completely swallowed up by the change, but she is still forever a different human after her experience. perhaps she was an allegory for those that stare suicide in the face, see that change on the other side, and reject it to emerge stronger on the other side. perhaps she's finally saying ""no, this form will not perish. who i am may be flawed, but i will own these flaws now. i will conquer them.""that's my two cents anyway.",1

2563,have you checked out wheel of time? that is an engrossing series that has sprouted several subreddits in its on right.,1
2564,sure - but that's not dune.dune has some of the most deeply nuanced characters in science fiction. there is an entire religious system introduced in these books that is explained in glimpses and appendices that helps understand why certain characters act in the way they do. an entire socio-economic understanding of arrakis and spice is made clear based on the interactions of the other houses. to say nothing of the clarity of why house harkonnen is held in such regard even after their well known barbarism. how deeply does the audiobook cover feyd-rautha and his intentions? the seduction of feyd-rautha by the ambassador's wife (the ambassador being a cuckold at best)? how much of the orange catholic bible is reviewed? or the revelation of what really happened with duncan idaho?,1

2609,"it’s definitely a trilogy worth reading for the amazing ideas alone, but the writing is sub-par and it’s too forgiving of the chinese government. i can’t blame the author for that last one, because i’m sure he wants to live a life outside of prison.the dark forest theory is pretty great, but unlikely. humans (or, intelligent life) has already realized it is better for survival to cooperate rather than execute that theory. although if you think about it, the dark forest theory is very applicable to life in the animal kingdom, pre-civilization.death’s end had some great ideas but i really didn’t like the characters. he tried to show how femininity is portrayed as weak but isn’t really weak after all - and this latter part didn’t really come through too well. and i felt like he spent too much effort trying to neatly explain !the end of time!< but that it would have been stronger leaving some things unsaid. and i loved the sections about the different !space ships trying to escape earth and devolving into a mini dark forest theory. pretty awesome execution of his theory.!<",1

2681,it continually breaks my heart that we won't get another iain m banks culture novel. it's just such a rich universe he's created.i just find the whole premise extremely compelling and incredibly hopeful and weirdly dark at the same time. i mean a supposed anarchic society run by hyper-intelligent ai that caters to their citizens every need in a way that makes star trek post-scarcity seem like child's play. the ai takes care of their humans just to have something to do and because it's morally right while some also side plot other goings-on to guide the galaxy in their fashion is something i find deadly interesting and haven't been able to find captured by any other author.,1

2685,"i super love the magic system. it makes brandon sanderson's magic look poorly developed. and i thought every character but the main character was good. unfortunately the main character is so, so bad that i can only recommend the book to people who are really interested in magic systems or want to read a train wreck. it's a shame because if kvothe had any nuance it'd probably be one of my favorite series, even unfinished.",1

2807,here a list of a few upcoming novels worth checking out,1
2808,"i've a few thoughts on this movie, some of which gel nicely, others which clash or diverge wildly, but here goes:1. lena isnt who she claimed to be. much like the alien she reflects back what she believes is correct. in this case she projects the image of the loyal wife. 2. lena damages and changes the relationship much like the alien damages and changes the characters own dna.3. her hubby (isaac, cant recall the character name) is also damaged/changed by her.4. hubby may also have been projecting a more humane self to her (mimicry? inherited self-imaging based on social standards? survival) but she saw a more primal demented violent version of him when he sliced open his comrades stomach and showed excitement at his findings within.5. speaking of - the snake thing within the stomach is to me an allegory for the human outside and the beast within.6. earth is a biome which becomes host to the shimmer (a cancer). the shimmer is a biome which then hosts the two squads. as the shimmer expands across its host, influencing and changing it, so do the squads influence and change the biome of the shimmer.7. or the shimmer is spacetime reacting to the arrival of this zone/entity, and the morphing/absorption/transference is less a conscious or instinctive element of the shimmer, and more a result of spacetime itself changing, and those who inhabit it (humans and fauna being baryonic matter completely beholden to the warping of spacetime) merging and mutating as a natural (or unnatural) consequence.8. the object which kills and absorbs the squad leader seems to either be a conscious mind manifest, or a multidimensional portal converting matter to pure energy and converting it into lena 2.0. either way it is to my mind a shimmer mirror image or a spacetime self-replication (as matter/energy are part of, not inhabitants in, spacetime).9. hubby returns a husk or a changeling. we cannot know if he is the same person because in truth no one is. everything and everyone changes and the scale of this cha gets hinges on the trigger event, its lasting impact, and of the perception of the observer.10. lena too has changed as a result of (a) damaging her marriage (b) suffering emotional trauma and guilt and shame (c) facing and interacting with the shimmer (d) absorbing some of her squad's identity (see the tattoo) (e) facing herself and seeing both exact copy and trans dimensional copycat (f) re-emerging both unsure of herself and her hubby i think this film is far less about alien encounters and far more about what we dont know or understand about ourselves and others, and the actions we and they take, and the impact that can have both on our psyches and on our moral balances.it's not a perfect movie by any means, i felt disconnected from the characters which going by devs may be intentional, but for me didnt work. i also missed the first-person perspective of the first book and the intensity of the underground tunnel she found there, it felt a lot more personal and the stakes far higher. but i still love garland's singular vision and admire his ventures into the human mind via half sci fi have gothic horror pathways.",1

""ball lightning"", while not as focused or compelling as the three-body novels, is very good. i'm currently making my way through ""invisible planets"", an anthology of chinese scifi translated by ken liu, it's very good; it and the three-body books are definitely gateways to chinese scifi.",1

2838,"in the book, several members of various expeditions into area x mysteriously reappear in society, but in the movie, it’s just kane.my theory for the film is that the alien in area x used kane to learn how to copy itself into a human form that could plausibly pass for a normal human being in society. this failed, however, when the copy of kane wasn’t able to retain his personality or proper organ function and promptly started dying outside of area x.the alien then used lena to learn how to make a better copy of a human, one who could seem like she was destroying area x, one who could return to tell the tale, one who could keep lena’s personality, one who could somehow cure kane so that the alien could keep reproducing in society undetected.so even though we think we see lena destroying the alien in the lighthouse, that’s not really lena. because the bodies “switch” when lena blacks out.thematically, the theory is supported by the idea that lena (lena’s clone) seems like she’s teaching the alien (lena) how to self destruct using the phosphorus grenades, but she eventually runs away rather than self-destructing. so it’s not really an act of self-destruction but murder of the other. the alien never learns the concept of self-destruction and so continues existing in/as lena.",1
2839,"the 'skylark' series is the other ee doc smith series - 'lensman' is more of a ""galactic police"" series (like buzz lightyear's ""space rangers"" or the ""green lantern corps"") whereas 'skylark' is more of a ""lost in space"" series (super scientist constantly building bigger/faster/stronger ships and going on adventures with friends/family/rival).i've read both series and find them really interesting in a historical way.  they're some of the first examples of ""space opera"" science fiction -  written around 100 years ago - and influenced so much stuff that came after.  however, before i'd recommend these to anyone there's some huge things to deal with. since so many things have copied from it, it falls into the trap of seinfeld is unfunny(  it's also super dated (i mean, as expected...) - in language, social attitudes, storytelling, etc.  for language - it's not like 'the canterbury tales' or shakespeare levels - but there are tons of phrases/slang/etc. from the time period it was written.  as for social attitudes - it's not actually as bad as most fiction from this period - i'm sure it was super progressive for the 1920's.  he doesn't write women all that well, but at least generally treats them as well as other male characters.  there's a lot of 'pedastalizing' though.  as far as i can remember, all the characters are pretty much default white... other than shiro (main character's butler/manservant... shades of the 'the green hornet') and his wife lotus blossom ( who is always described as ""small and dainty"" or ""a living doll"" but also ""one of the most proficient female experts in unarmed combat then alive""). on the storytelling front - all the heroes are always the best at everything and could even teach kvothe how to be an even better mary sue. deus ex machina is their way of life.  lots of cool scenes, but also a lot of telling instead of showing and infodumps. no real qualms with wiping out entire alien civilizations because it's justified because they're apparently 100% evil (even the women... and the children...).i feel like, instead of directly bringing 'skylark' or 'lensman' series to the screen, most people chose to take aspects of it and adapt it into their own story.  it would be cool to see an updated version of these stories - despite all the complaints above they are good fun stories - but i also worry that these would have the same problems as john carter(",1

2869,"but there's really not tons of good sci-fi with quality production and continuity. most of the shows get cancelled before they get finished, or they fizzle out at the end. i won't even begin watching a show anymore until it's been satisfactorily concluded. colony was starting to get good... cancelled. i'm glad that the last ship (not fully sci-fi, but had some sci-fi and dystopian/post-apocalyptic elements) was brought to completion. which is easy to do when you just give the writers and producers at least a season of advance warning so they can close the arcs.i think star trek is an amazing property and if they just made good episodes like tng, ds9, and voyager all did, we could be happy. even if there is a percentage of people who see it as mediocre or passe, lots of people will watch for the same reason that lots of people read typical fantasy books with swords and dragons and mages. it's a fun and imaginative bit of escapism, if done well. they don't even need to innovate, just literally make a show with a ship exploring the galaxy and finding a new planet every episode.",1

2912,"i personally would recommend the ringworld saga and larry niven's books in general. also, not to be patronizing, but lotr is not sci-fi, but fantasy :-) (as far as i understand the two different genres to be)",1
2913,"i found it no more depressing than reality. i like a good disney fairytale from time to time, but the reality of existence is harsh. people are great, but put more than a handful together and you get fear and distrust. once thousands are involved you get war and genocide. i will take a 2d death over that, if just to break the monotony of the cold, starless, future we are heading for.",1
2914,"i dunno, i think the dresden books are a valid suggestion. they're not ""epic"" like the lord of the rings, but if we're comparing movies they're more like the marvel ones. fun, entertaining, and surprisingly detailed if you pay attention. butcher is really good at foreshadowing.granted, the first 2-3 books aren't the greatest though.",1
2915,sandersons skyward is great,1
2916,"if you haven't already, check out his stormlight chronicles and a few of his other standalones like elantris and warbreaker.",1
2917,you need to study the names to understand the plot,1
2918,lies of locke lamora,1
2919,"if he wanted to, he would have done it. the first foundation book was published by asimov in 1951.  the last in 1993.  the longest gap was from '53 to '81, close to three times as long as we've waited for the third kingkiller.",1
2920,everything sanderson rights is cream of the crop.i'm listening to the reckoners series right now.,1
2921,"i know that robert heinlein is iffy with a lot of people, and it's been a while since i read his ""juveniles"" but i remember really enjoying ""starman jones"" and ""have spacesuit, will travel"".maybe check those out - they were written as ya and a couple were serialized in boys life magazine.",1
2922,"kingkiller is excellent,expeditionary force series is probably one of my all time favoritesreckoners series my sanderson is excellent, listening to that nowmonster hunter international series is my jam.red rising series is on par with stormlight",1
2923,"op should note that the feist's books are kind of a series of series that don't necessitate reading them in order. several books are basically standalone. that being said, definitely start with ""the riftwar saga"", magician: apprentice, magician: master, silverthorn, and a darkness at sethanon.",1
2924,"stop there, go and read his robots books, and come back. in fact, many of asimov's books are more connected than they appear at a glance. the end of eternity, for example. and nemesis implies the beginning of !the spacers!<. which isn't really that big of a spoiler, i guess, but i'll leave it.",1
2925,"i listened to the audiobook in german and found it interesting on some parts (especcially book2) and boring in some others (most of book 1 and the ending .... )in german the names of the chinese are standing out extremely and i had a really hard time to recognize people by their names.   the concept of the dark forest is a new one (at least for me) and i did find it intriguing but man i was happy when the whole ending finally was finished. this whole universe in a bubble thing/taking mass from the rest of the universe was absolute crap and i couldn't wait until it was finished.but in retrospect, i would say i have read way worse scifi and also a lot better ones.",1
2926,"it's hard to explain without spoiling things, but complexity isn't the issue. the story is incredibly complex, and i agree with u/squidjuggler, it's one of the best scifi stories i have ever read. the way it plays with how we conceptualize language and communication is masterful.",1
2927,"kingkiller has 2 novels and one novella and may never be finished but it's beautiful writing and a great story so i definitely recommend if you can give up hope on a 3rd.right now sanderson's stormlight archive is where the big action is at. great characters, a great world, hard magic system, and a story that could really go anywhere. not enough people have read the broken earth trilogy by nk jemesin. it borders both genres, and is some of the best books i've read in years.",1
2928,joe is a great writer.  i love how i hate everyone pretty much in his world.,1
2929,malazan book of the fallen,1
2930,"i recall wondering how the heck jordan could possibly wrap up the series satisfactorily. sanderson did an amazing job. to the point it made me check out his mistborn books, which are pretty damn good too.",1
2931,"i found it to be more challenging a read rather than an enjoyable one. i would say i liked it and thought it had some good ideas, but you have to be in the mood for it.",1
2932,"mieville can be over the top at times, that is sort of his trademark, but his worlds are entirely believable. most of his work is a type of urban fantasy but embassytown is straight science fiction. the twin-thing is not a big part of the story it just helps us understand similes. the description of these aliens' language is just mind-blowing. mieville doesn't just say ""the language was totally different"" but rather he enables us to understand the structure of the language and how language shapes a species. linguistics is sort of the motif or maybe the theme of the novel - it takes center stage.",1
2933,"babylon 5. lots of humanoids, and lots of not, especially the ancient races and first ones that have real mystery, and the show provides satisfying answers. farscape because many aliens were muppets that were only limited to imagination. it's seriously weird and gross and wonderful and hilarious.",1
2934,"i bought that before bookstores closed down, i havent picked it up yet (reading other stuff). i cant wait!!",1
2935,"check out the lensman series by ee doc smith. light fare, mostly. really surprised they never made it into tv in some form. smith also created another series that i liked more but remembered less. someone else will probably bring it up.",1
2936,thank you! i just watched it! i love diving into metaphors and symbols. and i usually het closure by discussing them rather than a perfect ending for the film!,1
2937,kingkiller is a complex and beautifully written read! huge fantasy fan here and i think they’re a really refreshing and captivating plot with the classic elements of high fantasy!,1
2938,the young explorer’s adventure guide series is an anthology series of exactly that i think.,1
2939,"loved that book, taurens where interesting",1
2940,i'd suggest any of trudi canavan's trilogies and the broken earth trilogy by nk jemisin as well.,1
2941,holy shit- the ending of use of weapons.,1
2942,"i whole-heartedly suggest the kingkiller chronicles. it's such a great example of really good story telling. also, the audiobooks are really good as well. i'd recommend the british version.",1
2943,"haven't read it, but i feel like it would be a tough sell to believe a language is so complicated that it requires twins with artificially linked minds. that... just screams ridiculous",1
2944,have you seen these in audiobook? i think audible had the first one but no other.such a good series.,1
2945,"i just downloaded the first one, i hope it is good. the chinese names might be confusing but i will give it a shot.",1
2946,kingkiller isn't finished and arguably isn't that good.,1
2947,"neal asher's polity books are fun reads. many of them deal mainly with the struggles between ai controlled society and separatist movements. but the polity trilogy he's doing right now, starting with the soldier, gives a much deeper look at the jain civilization. they are definitely alien.",1
2948,the broken earth series by n.k. jemisin,1
2949,"yeah, go with rosemary kirstein's steerswoman series instead.",1
2950,i personally find it one of my favourite series. i just found it different. each book district from the previous and profound in its own way. though i know this is an unpopular opinion,1
2951,the dark elf trilogy by r. a. salvatore,1
2952,"ken liu translated the first and third books in english, and i generally found them to flow and read easier, not to say that that dark forest was poorly translated. people have commented in the past that all three books are amazing in native chinese, so that leads me to assume that maybe there are parts which are lost in translation.",1
2953,there are some nice doctor who spin-offs torchwood( and the sarah jane adventures(,1
2954,"memory, sorrow, and thorn by tad williams: the series that inspired a song of ice and fire.it's a finished trilogy but there is a sequel trilogy that will be finished this year.",1
2955,"i think i'm an outlier with these books. i read tbp when it was nominated (and then won) the hugo, and i really didn't care for it. as time went on, i realized that i just didn't like it, but i hated it. and even in the year of the sad puppies, it shouldn't have won the hugo. really poor 1-d characters, a plot that makes no sense, a ""video game"" that is completely unplayable or logical, bad dialogue, an alien society that makes no physical sense, terrible character interaction...it's just so bad. sure, some of the ideas are neat, but at the expense of literally everything else that makes a book enjoyable.",1
2956,"you might like some jack vance.  there's a great gateway omnibus with big planet, the blue world, the dragon masters and other stories.  also try emphyrio and night lamp.  really good blend of sci-fi and fantasy.",1
2957,check out the first law trilogy by joe abercrombie the blade itself is book 1 of the trilogy and i can’t recommend it enough,1
2958,"you would enjoy both books, you would not enjoy waiting for the third. but i find that gives me more time to read other books.",1
2959,"if you want a novel of just aliens - no humans at all, try john brunner's the crucible of time( i think it is one of very few that just tells the tale of an alien species from generation to generation.",1
2960,check out the black company books by glen cook for a good dark fantasy series.,1
2961,"agreed, #4 iron gold is good but #5 dark age is fantastic",1
2962,fair.,1
2963,yea i finished first book and was totally blown away. i love the science and feel the book is just something fresh to read.,1
2964,yes!! i was hoping someone would recommend this book series. i’m on book 4 and i’m absolutely hooked!!!,1
2965,"i've read some of the series mentioned here and now i'm on the fifth book of malazan books of the fallen. it's great in my opinion and while there are too many books out there to trudge through one you don't like, i would say to really try to get through the first book. i feel that the complexity of the world in malazan makes me feel more immersed. it's okay that you don't memorize every name, location, and map. the ones that interest you will stick.",1
2966,"kingkiller chronicles were 2 of the best books ive read in a really really long time.  its a shame that you decided to not bother based on one persons random comment.  read  to read - not for some kind of perceived investment or wasted effort? you're here asking for recommendations because you're looking for good books to add to your list :)  the concept of that ""trilogy"" being unfinished is silly.  was the 2nd book not as good as the first? depends i guess.  either way i really enjoyed reading both back to back and my life doesn't feel unfinished as a result of knowing that theres likely never going to be a third or more (as sad as that may be to accept) ;)",1
2967,another vote for the red rising series. they are bestsellers but i’m surprised they’re not even more popular. i need to catch up on the latest 2 but the first 3 books are some of my favorites from this century,1
2968,"jack vance! again i am surprised how far it took me to scroll to see the two authors get their first mentions, ursula k le guinn and jack vance have great aliens to read. i especially liked vance's the gray prince.",1
2969,"the speaker for the dead series is pretty interesting in how it depicts humanity's interactions with many kinds of uncommon alien lifeforms, new forms of humanity, and non-biological life. one of its major themes is how we can develop empathy for new kinds of life.",1
2970,"sorry, i tend not to commit mediocre writing to memory.",1
2971,can't believe i had to scroll all the way down here to see the first mention of ursula's amazing book the left hand of darkness. definitely a must read!,1
2972,"if you don't mind your sci-fi a bit of cheesy, space precinct(",1
2973,"the darkover books by marion zimmer bradley.most things by l.e. modesitt, though to be honest some of the books in the latter stages of ""the saga of recluse"" seemed repetitive to me.  all of the non-dresden books by jim butcher.  i liked the dresden books, they just don't seem to fit your question.",1
2974,i agree but as you said you need to read it before your read anvil which has some interesting aliens.,1
2975,their specific mechanism for communication is a major plot point but you didn’t find unique? haha what?,1
2976,"the wheel of time is great! and long. but great! it's fantasy with a lot of magic which is described a lot better than in other books. it can be dark at times, but has a great ending (once you get there). read the first book, if you like it, try the other 14.",1
2977,my thoughts exactly!,1
2978,"blindsight!  i’ve read a lot of first contact books, and this is the one where aliens felt truly alien.  in others like mote in gods eye, are basically humans with different culture and they learn english almost immediately.",1
2979,"the author is a trans woman who is not shy about telling reactionary right-wingers to fuck off on twitter, and the show's pretty queer too. so it gets hate from the comicsgaters/sad puppies/etc.",1
2980,"seconded. rothfuss's gotten himself caught in a writer's trap. his first two were so well received that he can't publish the third one until he considers it perfect, or it will tarnish his previous work. since nothing can ever be perfect, he won't ever publish it.",1
2981,the short story it's based on is worth a read in its own right.,1
2982,"iain m banks - start with use of weapons, then if you like it go from consider phlebas. joe abercrombie - start with the first law. william gibson - start with his second last, the peripheral.  if you like his style, go from neuromancer!add some classics in too: forever war, i am legend, the stars my destination (called tiger, tiger i believe in the us).",1
2983,"i absolutely loved _authority_ — it’s one of very few books i’ve finished reading and then immediately started reading again from the beginning. i don’t really want to spoil it for you, but only when you reach the end do you realize that there’s been something insidious going on the entire time, some corruption coming out of area x and infecting the real world, and whatever control control thought they had over things was always an illusion. definitely definitely definitely worth reading.",1
2984,"i suppose. wouldn't call it that interesting, there's lower level life on earth that hibernates that way.",1
2985,yes!! this is my favorite series!!,1
2986,"they didn't restart the evolutionary cycle, since they could survive. they restarted civilization.",1

3030,"it depends on what you like about those authors.  epic certainly seems to be the common denominator.if that's what you're looking for, i would recommend you check out the wheel of time series by robert jordan.  it was conceived and plotted completely by him, and he wrote 11 books and a prequel before his untimely death in 2007.  brandon sanderson finished the final three volumes based on his notes.  the fan response to the end has been overwhelmingly positive.jordan was a master of foreshadowing.  he put hints and clues even in the first book, the eye of the world, that play out both at the end of that first book, as well as others that play out throughout the rest of the story and the end.the story is what i consider to be the last great hero's journey of classic fantasy before the modern era.  it and song of ice and fire marked a watershed in the 90s in what kind of fantasy was published.  the story is generally about a young man who is told that he must unite the nations and become the savior of the world - but the cost of saving it will be his sanity and his life.  there are thousands of characters (literally, two thousand seven hundred and eighty-two characters), both major and minor.",1
3031,"the movie is pretty good at capturing the overall strangeness of the books. i gather they knew there would be no attempt to make movies out of authority or acceptance, and the ending of this one reflects that.    still worth watching.",1
3032,no third kkc?! waaaat?!,1
3033,i second the hyperion series and john scalzi's work. i think his recently finished interdependency series was pretty good and am a fan of his writing style in general.,1

3039,"i felt the same about the witcher, it’s probably something to do with the original text being in polish. every language has quirks that come through even when it’s translated, although i couldn’t point to anything specific. i only got around to reading space odyssey a coupe years ago, after seeing the movie way back. i didn’t know until then that the book and screenplay were written together, instead of one based on the other. you really do need both to understand what’s going on, the book for the meaning and the movie for the tone/atmosphere.  it goes totally off the rails (in a good way) in the sequels though.",1
3040,if you go onto the shudder discord they're doing a live viewing of the movie.,1

3049,"hyperion cantos, maybe. i’d say the quality really shines in the imagery, the characters are also quite good and the world design is interesting, but the plot is too ambitious for it’s own good. you might like the witcher books, i haven’t finished them but so far they’re solid quality, if not exceptional. if you haven’t already read arthur c clarke’s space odyssey series i’d recommend it pretty highly, especially if you thought the movie was disappointing.",1
3050,so i never read those books but it reminded me of roadside picnic - did the author get inspiration from that book or something?  i could never find any articles about it,1
3051,you'll probably like 'foundation' by isaac asimov. it's a really big epic on par with lotr and dune.   or maybe neuromancer by william gibson. though i'm not really a fan of the noir writing style myself.,1

3057,the first law trilogy by joe abercrombie. enjoy.  the audio books are truly exceptional.,1
3058,the riftwar books by ray feist,1
3059,"most of us would recommend not reading kingkiller. it was advertised as a done trilogy needing publication but there will never be a 3rd book and the second book is not as good as the first.try brian mcclellan, raymond feist, brent weeks, anthony ryan, robert jordan, robin hobb, and joe abercrombie. i also highly recommend the dresden files for a nice change.though scifi and fantasy are two different things. you did mention dune though. try joe scalzi's old man war, david weber's honor harrington series, the hyperion series by dan simmons, most anything by peter f hamilton,  neal stephenson, orson scott card, or alastair reynolds. the expanse series is great. wool by hugh howey is a great short read. so is armor by john steakley.i could keep typing for days but this should start you off.ps- the malazan series is highly praised but might be hard to digest on first read through",1
3060,"yeah, it's just an art project. by a couple of fans.  sadly.  we can hope netflix throws a ton of money at it and does a series or something.",1
3061,greg bear - blood wars was surprisingly original.jeff vandermeer - annihilation was infinitely intriguing and mysterious.james s corey - leviathan wakes for space zombies.,1
3062,"yes, i kept ignoring it until i read that it was directed by alex garland who also directed ex machina.",1
3064,yes that was one of the scariest monsters and concepts i’ve ever seen in a movie and it was so unexpected. i actually get goosebumps thinking about it.,1

(and great link, btw. thanks for sharing!)if you take a look at what is shown/said on picard, and what should have been the results/consequences of that, it's like a completely different universe. the worldbuilding of modern star trek is in utter ruins. a dumpster fire is better developed than this mess.some examples (obviously spoilers!): the decision made by the federation's legislative branch of government to just let almost one billion people die because of a (at least at that point and to public knowledge) completely unrelated terrorist attack should have sent the general public into an unprecedented uproar. → what actually happened: apparently nobody besides ""jl"" gave a single flying fuck about it. no noteworthy protests or demonstrations, no political fallout, no rioting, nada. giving borg an even more advanced version of the sikarian trajector than what was shown in voyager should have sent the borg on an assimilation spree across the galaxy, because they literally have a virus that can convert whole planets (voyager episode ""dark frontier""). → what actually happened: the borg sat on both technologies for decades without doing anything. let me say it again: the borg refused to use technology that would allow them to assimilate whole planets from 40,000 lightyears away. given that the romulans are a cunning and resourceful species with access to highly advanced technology, the refugee camp on vashti should have at least seen beginnings of development into a self-sufficient colony. → what actually happened: the romulans sat on their asses for a decade, built a distillery, built a west world like shantytown, and got drunk. most certainly not the type of planet with the knowledge, people, and infrastructure to support a network of tens of thousands of defense satellites.what a shame.",1

3454,"i think a huge issue with scifi in general is that it's difficult to make a film/show that can provide the same depth/complexity as a book. when it comes to portraying complex ideas or simply providing food for thought, a book is still the superior medium as it allows you to pause and ponder, digesting the content in a very different way - compared to moving images that are supposed to grab your attention for 30-60 minutes at a time.it's a real challenge (imho) to create something that isn't just an audio book with moving pictures. the nature of the film/show format itself requires interaction with characters and their environment to explain the themes one is about to explore and this dependence often tends to result in a lot more inter-character drama over time, up to a point where scifi becomes the backdrop.the film/tv format is mostly a distillate of a much more complex and elaborate medium, and it's almost impossible to avoid simplifications in order to create a more easily digestible experience. and it's not just because of the viewers that depth is being sacrificed, but also because of time constraints and other limitations that are intrinsic characteristics of film/tv as a medium.being a very good writer/producer is just one part of this challenge.",1

3512,"you basically just described every star trek series, especially tos.",1
3513,"jl hugging babies and ninjas with a stolen video game plot? screw you, i saw #1 grilling burgers!",1
3514,i already had a poor opinion of the new trek. that's why it felt right to just watch rlm and have them bitch about it for me.,1
3515,their idea of a punchup would leave the script lying in the corner with torn clothes and a bloody nose... and glitter.i'd really like to hear what harlan ellison would say to them.,1
3516,"harlin ellison didn't do drugs btw tho, pretty sure he was totally sober like his whole life",1
3517,starf leet...,1
3518,"eh, i dunno about that. michael chabon is a bona fide writer and picard ended up being total garbage (imo anyway, i know folks that liked it).there's only so much you can put on the screenwriter. tv and film are a collaborative process, hundreds of people working together to assemble a finished product. saying you can guarantee the success of a production based solely on writing is incredibly reductive. that said, the folks at the top (showrunners/producers) have the most influence over the entire production. in this case i have very little confidence they will put out a show that i will want to watch. i gave them the benefit of the doubt with discovery and picard and i really hated both shows. that's it i'm done with this generation of star trek. better luck in 20 years i guess.",1
3519," that way you will definitely have a good show. guaranteed.no matter who's writing it they're still gonna get boxed in because it's a prequel. you can't use anything that was introduced later, and you can't introduce anything that you can't explain why it's never mentioned later. you can throw canon to the wind, but then what's the point of doing a prequel?enterprise and discovery both suffered these problems and handled them less than gracefully imho. discovery in particular would have been a better show if they'd just set it post-voyager rather than pre-tos.picard was far from perfect but at least it was able to take the universe in interesting new directions worth exploring.for a franchise that's built on optimism and human progress the folks in charge seem deathly afraid of taking it in the direction of letting it actually progress. instead, they're weirdly hell-bent on mining it for nostalgia - the opposite of what star trek is about. till they get over that, i don't think there's any ""guarantee"" of a good show, no matter the cast.",1
3520,"one, or both? ",1
3521,"dude, if there were a person who did that the shows would at least have some internal cohesion, all thos ep fight constantly and they fuck iver each other",1
3522,"he was like a grumpy old man character from an adam sandler movie, just more well spoken",1
3523,"that's not my argument. but there is a certain amount of fiction you expect in science fiction. and in the case of star trek, that amount is very high.",1
3524,thats not my point. data had actual friends.,1
3525,"it's easy to ep multiple a series when you have an army of eps, co-eps, and producers working under you. seriously the number of fucking ep credits on shows these days is asinine, just look at discovery’s opening credits to have a laugh. that title means literally nothing 9 times out of 10. it's a contractual tactic to get a cooler credit and a little extra money on the next gig. alex has a light touch to guide the overall vision of these shows and be a face to the media, but there will be an ep/showrunner who is actually 100% focused on the 1 show and does all that work.",1
3526,"see, i sorta disagree with that read. picard wasn't ""friends"" with data, but he wasn't really friends with anyone. he kept some distance from the whole crew. but he showed data a great deal more patience than the rest of the crew, which is about as close to affection as his character came to in ng.",1
3527,"until half way in it was a mystery how the got the cube, what they were doing with it and what was going to happen to it.none of these things turned out to be the least bit interesting or even matter at all.",1
3528,"shit your right about the time traveling janeway. in the ""original"" timeline it took them 20-30 years to get back to the alpha quadrant, she got it so they got back in 8-9 years. but picard would still have well over a decade of dealing with his borgifcation. it was only first contact to my knowledge which showed picard having any kind of borg ptsd. as for sevon of nine being unique...she wasn't. there was an entire plot with hugh and lore releasing a bunch of borg from the collective that stayed released. frankly no character in stp act like their past characters + time. data and picard were never that close. they respected each other but where not friends.",1
3529,why would they hire him again? he is already the main executive producer in charge of all the new trek,1

3532,too bad the fourth season completely changed the tone of the series and dragged on like molasses. dammit amazon.,1
3533,"i’m just picturing this thread as a bunch of simpsons comic book guys bitching to each other in a basement. the hive mind of “new star treks bad! orville good!” is ridiculous, orville has plenty of shitty episodes/writing, and the new treks have plenty of good stuff, it’s never nearly as black and white as the reddit hive mind.",1
3534,the brains behind tv seem to think fantasy dressed up in sci-fi clothes is sci-fi,1
3535,i thought janeway changed the timeline in the finale? is there math on the altered timeline? were they still out there for 23 years?,1
3536,voyager returns about 40 years after the events of best of both worlds.,1
3537,"i had assumed they met shortly after voyager got back, like offscreen. they seemed like they had more than a passing acquaintance in the show.",1
3538,"i believe this is the core of the problem: discovery was not a bad show -- it wasn't genius, but it wasn't bad either. but it wasn't star trek. i know many fans missed the utopian outlook but honestly i was ok with that. what i missed was the exploration of societal moral dilemmas?    in enterprise there was the episode where flox found out that the planet they were currently at was inhabitated by two intelligent humanoid species. the dominant suffering from a degrading gene defect the secondary one at the at the verge of an evolutionary jump. the conflict (should we heal the currently suffering or allow evolution to go it's way?) was more star trek than anything in discovery (despite a complete misunderstanding of evolution). i believe to bring star trek to its heights again  you don't need a great writer, who writes interesting characters and coherent stories, but an average writer who can write star trek and is not afraid to show interesting view points to current topics. rubber-head aliens always had the great advantage, that they were clearly humans but no group currently living. so you could talk about problems without directly pointing fingers at anyone directly.",1
3539, the whole locutus thingwhat can she help him process that fourty years hasn't already done?,1
3540,"nah, but it stands to reason they'd have at least heard of each other upon her returning home. i can see him wanting to meet her out of curiosity/ wanting to process the whole locutus thing. the imaginary quote was more talking about me/my feelings on seeing these call backs.",1
3541,the original series did exactly that.,1
3542,"it's gotten to the point for me that star trek and star wars are ""entry level"" sci-fi. i still love the original trilogy and the original series of trek but for the most part, everything else has been uninspiring out of those two imo. the people that love them... great!!! i just don't see the writing for anything new in these universes being anywhere near as interesting as the originals.",1
3543,you’re getting downvoted because they only want to hate the new stuff and miss “the good old days”,1
3544,same. grew up with it. i’m excited to see how this year’s film turns out.,1

3550,"i sure didn't.the idea of klingons ""withdrawing"" for any reason flies in the face of all previous st portrayals.  they are in you face, like 'em or not.  they are loud, they are proud.  they go after what they want openly... most of the time, cunning sometimes dictates a different approach (though probably still not too subtle).the opening episode of st:d decided to make klingons into... romulans? why?  what was the point of this creative decision?  why not just pick some other st race instead?",1
3551,they weren't even trying to hide their hackery in the movies because they made sulu the sudden ninja. and he just happened to have a collapsible fucking katana on him.,1
3552,what is that supposed to mean? i guess it is a dig at people that enjoyed the sw sequels for what they were. tng had a child space wizard in the form of wesley crusher. criticising the new shows for things the old shows did is a double standard. especially when your whole fandom is based on nostalgic purism.,1

3768,correct!  roddenberry just created the story universe...  then he did something almost no producer would have -- let expert storytellers actually tell us what happened there.,1
3769,"for my money they can hire who they like. so long as alex kurtzman and akiva goldsman (writer of such classic fare as dark tower, batman & robin, transformers: last knight, davinci code, star trek into darkness to name a few gems) are still in charge then you'll get promises of this and that up the wazoo until the first trailer drops, but the story will...have at least one planet explodehave a character that fights like a ninja seemingly out of nowherehave a couple of side plots go nowhere at allhave random swearing to make it feel edgy and contemporaryhave endless nods and winks at the fandom essentially saying ""hey remember this thing from this thing you like... we remember it too"" and they'll get it wrong.have a finale with two fleets of millions of cut and paste ships face off against millions of cut and paste ships... perhaps spiced up with a third party getting involved mid way through. i mean between the kelvin-verse films, discovery and picard its literally a word template you can fill in yourself nowadays. and i have to say from a personal viewpoint as a long lapsed fan of trek who keeps hoping it will return to form; it seems to me that for a show that was about optimism, the celebration of science, exploration, pursuit of knowledge and looking towards a bright future, trek has got progressively more dumb, dark and backward looking. so yeah its nice lip service saying they have scifi writers on staff now, but frankly they should have had that from the start of this whole tv resurgence and i'm firmly in the believe it when i see it mode now after ~~mass effect rip off~~  ahem i mean picard which had the same ""we're not discovery, we're going back to thoughtful trek"" soundbites up until admirals started swearing, mars exploded, androids started ninja kicking romulans about and after a few cameos and dead end b plots we had a thousand star fleet vessels face down a thousand romulan ships, some space flowers and ~~non copyright infringing reapers~~ i mean artificial life that cycles around every 10000 years to harvest / wipe out organic life...so yeah... definitely mark me down as unconvinced..",1

3840,"i really love st. people complain so much that this isn't the piccard that they know and completely ignore that people change over time.also, i want my st to touch on current issues. that might not be what made st great, but it's what kept st relevant during the last 50 years.honestly, if the internet would have been a thing during tngs premiere, it would have been trashed so hard during s1 that a s2 probably wouldn't have happened.having said that( there's an issue with having a serialised st show. if you didn't like the overall plot, then you won't like the show in general. i haven't rewatched any episodes of piccard or disco since they aired, because there are barely any episodes that can stand on their own. i think this is the main problem with the new shows, but modern (streaming) tv kind of demands a serialised structure, since you want to keep viewers hooked. ds9 had a very serialised plot in the later seasons, but it worked because they had a lot of time building up to it.so i don't really know what the solution is here. and of course, st is special and you'll always piss off some fans. for me, ds9 is still the show that aged best because of its overarching plot, but it's probably hard to convince studio execs to do a few seasons of (mostly) standalones first. on the other hand, i really wished for a a well written serialised st show - there's so many great serialised shows on tv right now and i'm sad that st isn't among them.",1
3841,i think it was featured in the online game a few years back that neo and trinity were prototypes for machine/human hybrids or something like that. wonder if they would keep that in canon. still never understand why the machines kill everything instead of just leaving the planet and allowing us to kill ourselves.,1

(laumer actually worked for the state dept during the korean war, and has hinted at least some of retief's adventures were inspired by real-life diplomatic antics.)also not entirely spycraft, but wasp by eric frank russell also comes to mind.  it's about a special agent in an intergalactic war sent to an enemy planet, to use psychological warfare and insurrectionist tactics to destabilize the government.  there's plenty of espionage and clever bond-style gadgets in use!(warning: there's a very good likelihood that buying this book could put you on a list.  not even kidding.  it's basically a terrorist handbook, but a very funny and entertaining one.)",1

3997,"i recommend looking up the traveller rpg system, it's allegedly what firefly is based on, and there are a collection of novels set in the universe. the setting is primarily a ragtag crew on a flying bucket of bolts trading, shooting and flying!",1
3998,peter watts is my all favorite author right now. he does aliens so well. and humans... depressingly.,1
3999,i really hope this doesn't affect the opening date.  i loved the idea of john wick 4 and matrix 4 being scheduled to open on the same day.,1
4000,"i totally agree that the writing could have been better. i think they needed more women in the room to construct better characters all around, particularly janeway, but also kes, b'elanna, and seven. agree that the doctor is one of the most interesting, as data was on tng. i still believe it contributed a lot to the longevity of st. it was really meaningful for me to grow up watching a female captain, as a little nerdy girl. i also always liked the holodeck episodes a lot. i know tng had some as well. kudos for watching all the series and pushing through voyager even if it wasn't your cup of tea. i appreciate your analysis and don't disagree that the series was uneven and needed better writing sometimes. maybe it has the kind of potential that leads to an interesting revisit or reboot some other day, as the new films did with alternative storylines for tos.thanks again for the comment!",1
4001,is the rook the one with with the gal that wakes up with amnesia in the first episode?,1
4002,omg really?? awesome,1
4003,"yes, sorry. i worded that badly!",1
4004,"lmaoi literally finally pushed through voyager today.  i'm trying to do all trek.  i loved ds9 and had high hope's for voyager but it sucked soooooooo bad.  there are exactly two interesting characters on the show, the dr and seven and you dont even get seven still season 4.  the rest of the cast is just so boring.  janeway should have been good but her characterization is all over the map depending on each episodes plot making her frustrating. everyone else has basically a single personality point and that's what you get each episode. then the utter wasted potential of the show.  such a great premise - two hostile crews trapped across the galaxy and who must work together to get home.   the show rarely touched on this and you would have no clue half the crew were maquis in the vast majority of episodes.then the stupid writing.  the ship is racing home yet in season 6 a character from season 2 that was left behind catches up to them in a shuttle in days despite all the distance voyager supposedly covered.  this works on a show like tng but not voyager but then the writers basically were just writing tng 2.0.   so many instances of this kind of nonsensical writing. this show could have been what the battlestar galactica reboot was where they showed what it would actually be like to be a ship alone and a crew stressed beyond belief.   instead we got a poor version of tng.then the finale episode.  ds9 had a great finale as it wrapped up all the dangling plots and then devoted the last half hour to basically be an extended goodbye.  voyager climaxes with about a minute left and then just ends.  you know they made it home but you dont see it. even though i really didnt like the cast i still would have liked to have seen how the maquis were accepted, how the dr was accepted, harry seeing his parents, paris seeing his dad, etc.",1
4005,sg1 ended on a high note after 8 seasons and no one can tell me otherwise.,1
4006,"they didn't even bother to keep picard in focus much of the time.maybe their goal is to get us accustomed to not being able to see what's going on, so they can eventually switch to an all-audio format, since special effects are so expensive.next time, they won't even turn the lights on while they're shooting.",1
4007,did the prime directive even exist at that point? it was pre-federation.also how would it be a violation of the prime directive?,1
4008,i read the first enders... will consider the series,1
4009,"if you haven't read /listened to ender's game, that would be a good audio book for you, i think.david weber's honorverse books on audio are decent, but nowhere near as dark as donaldsontheee is also the bobiverse by taylor, if you like geek humor and space exploration",1
4010,the rook is only one season. not sure if planned or cancel but just the one.,1
4011,"i hope to god it's good because i'm far too excited to get all these new trek shows.if it's bad it'll really suck for anson mount. after the inhumans fiasco with scott buck, it'd be really unfortunate to have another show fail with him in the forefront (especially after he's proven to be such a great pike).",1
4012,"i thought i was the only person to watch counterpart!!excellent show, i'll give the rook a try as you obviously have good taste!",1
4013,"the first couple of enterprise episodes (at least not sure never really watched a lot of enterprise) they are fighting to get whatever technology they can from the vulcan even though that is against there own prime directive.  they believe in it, but they don't want to apply it to themselves.",1
4014,it is star trek as far as it tries to retain a progressive ethic and a hopeful attitude.it's true that they've catered to the populists by adding cursing and some more militarism but generally it's still got that star trek ethos.,1
4015,"why the fuck would they bring back kurtzman? i doubt current fans have much loyalty to him, and for those who dislike the new stuff he's the reason. his name is cancer to the brand",1
4016,"only to you, and you can still objectively criticize it and enjoy parts you still enjoy.  if you must hate something because there are bad parts into it, okay, no one can ever like bsg.  no one can like farscape.  no one can like star trek tng because it has a few terrible episodes in season 1.  no one can like himym.  no one can like literally anything, just because there are bad parts in it.  by your logic, the end of stargate sg1, which was bad because the series was cancelled in the middle of season ten makes the entire series that bad.do you see how ridiculous and preposterous you sound now?  someone's enjoyment of something is not tied into arbitrary standards and imdb ratings.",1
4017,"you're throwing out the new content without sampling it.the trailer didn't do it justice. that's not to say you'll like it either. neither season was about to give us something like ""city on the edge of forever"" or ""best of both worlds.""my only point is that refecting it for the trailer is limiting your options. it doesn't give you much to express your opinion.",1

4025,,1
4026,so this is random but from an outsiders perspective what is a true star trek fans opinion on the abrams films? they’re all that i’ve seen of star trek and i’m just genuinely curious where they fall on the scale of good and bad star trek.,1
4027,"solaris is a good starting point - the whole planet is alive and for decades a human mission of scientists has been trying to communicate with it. the gap series by stephen donaldson has the amnion who are very different from us. they aren't the center point of the series at first but their influence grows, so push beyond the first book. a fire upon the deep has by far the most inventive ""very alien"" aliens that i know of.the gods themselves is another solid one, given that there's another universe involved...the algebraist by ian m banks has gas-giant dwellers who are really quite different.",1
4028,"mote in god's eye, cowritten by niven and pournelle. man's first contact/mystery story with aliens. the moties are almost completely different than humans.",1
4029,"greg egan's orthogonal features aliens that live in a different universe, where the speed of light is not constant. his incandescence novel features creatures that live on an asteroid orbiting something fierce (black hole or neutron star, i never figured out). his dichronauts features aliens living in a universe where one of the space dimensions points the same direction as the time dimension. indeed, pretty much every one of his books investigates either aliens or humans in situations so alien it reads like a robert forward novel. :-)",1
4030,the way he described the squids was very well done also; they truly seemed alien even though they’re a terrestrial organism originally.,1
4031,"unfortunately seth has a big overall nbcuniversal deal:   &#x200b;he's allowed to keep working on existing fox projects, but anything new is going to be owned by nbc which kinda rules out him working on actual trek for a long time.",1
4032,"that’s the first book i thought of when i read the post as well, haha. i love the way the aliens were portrayed: so alien that the concept of self was off the table.",1
4033,"also, pretty much all other hal clement novels. :-)",1
4034,"i'd agree with you on the new sw movies, but what did you think about the mandalorian?",1
4035,there's plenty of us in this very thread._one_ of you did equate watching new star trek with watching puppies stomped on.  i hope that's just one or there are some more prevalent emotional attachment issues,1
4036,"i’m a newer trek fan that discovered it through netflix, so i skipped over most of the bad episodes using imdb. so i wasn’t forced to watch the bad episodes like the ppl who experienced enterprise (or any trek) on tv — with that formats constraints.also can you expand on your premise?i thought star fleet came off as humanitarians that were glad they were evolving! like jfk’s assassination never happened and humanity regained its innocence by ending war and poverty.",1

4048,"the color of distance by amy thomson.  the tendu are intelligent amphibians who communicate by using color patterns on their skin.  the novel alternates between their perspective and a human one.  probably one of the most engrossing novels i have ever read with an alien perspective.  it is also a more cerebral version of science fiction.  the stakes are high, but the conflict is more mundane than an unrealistic military confrontation.  highly recommended.",1
4049,mentats are not computers/ai. they're human.,1
4050,sounds like a the orville ripp-off...,1
4051,it sounds like you're already resigned to a mostly bad show.,1
4053,i loved ds9 too even though it wasnt a planet visiting kind of series. i totally agree with you.honestly those shows turned star trek into riverdale rather than trek,1
4054,"star trek fans, the people who hate star trek the most.",1
4055,"different fans want different things. ds9 is my favorite trek and i love the more serialized format of the later seasons. discovery and picard weren't bad because they were serials, they were bad because they were bad.",1
4056,correct. the sections are the story told from the human universe and the alien universe. both are getting free power from the other universe.,1
4057,"i mean surely you can spare an hour to watch one episode of new trek, jesus",1
4058,i wish i didn't care. seems better than actively despising it.,1

4067,"star trek already has its own unholy triumvirate. akiva goldsman, kirsten beyer and alex kurtzman. as long as these people are still the main creative force in star trek i'm not really interested.",1
4068,"like the idea, but found it difficult to read. in the first sentence, i stopped at the word ""overwhelm"" because the definition and use in the sentence didn't match well.  maybe easier to read: ""the lower west sector was overwhelmed by..."" or ""tattered clothes and endless voices overwhelmed the lower west sector as the citizens of terra waited for the ambassador's announcement.""defining a display brand in a short story may not add the feel i think you are going for. minimize descriptions and use powerful words instead.i don't think the use of a parenthetical description is great in the middle of a quote. ""... from pod..."" should be left as is, and explain it later if you want. try reading the sentences aloud, and see how they roll off the tongue.watch capitalization - most words don't deserve it. try to use simple past tense verbs instead of past perfect with helping verb had. it is much easier to read ""your mother and i spent years...""  than ""your mother and i had spent years...""your writing suggests that you have a good feel for drawing the reader in - use that sense and pare it down until you get that feeling in every single sentence.best wishes!",1
4069,"not exclusivity, but it certainly was a factor.there's been lots of bad trek over the years.  but when you have one plot per season, you have to hit it out of the park.discovery and picard couldn't afford bad stories because of that.  but a series that gets ten per season?  better odds.",1
4070,i look forward to at least one episode where a crewmember (male or female) is impregnated by a ghost.,1
4071,you will find a lot of advice and help at the kboards,1
4072,"yep, i fucking loved picard and discovery was entertaining enough to bear-down through some of the hilarious plot points.  i don't see it having the same sort of legs though. s02 was harder to swallow but i dug the premise, we'll see how it goes.",1
4073,wrong subreddit.  this is /r/scifi.,1
4074,"im fairly confident it will, my main worry is that if it is successful in terms of viewership numbers that there will be pressure from the executive levels to start doing large story archs and cliffhangers.seen many a tv show ruined that way after their first few seasons. not that im against large story archs or cliffhangers in general.. just that they are for a very different type of show from what im hoping for with this.",1
4075,"yeah, but again... why did michael burnham have to be tied to spock at all? that one character decision, imo, doesn't give the series (or any spinoff) the freedom that it could have.",1
4076,that makes way more sense.nobody said spock was the first vulcan. just bc they occasionally got annoyed by him doesn’t mean he was the first of his kind to serve in star fleet.,1
4077,lots of free ebooks on there too,1

4081,"ok. point taken. i hadn't experienced that, but makes sense.",1

4083,"just because people do use it for things it isn't intended for doesn't mean that's what you're supposed to do. it's why amazon is littered with millions of useless, pointless books that get in the way of legitimate authors trying to sell their wares. anyone who just throws crap up on amazon is actively harming others.",1
4084,tough to use another captain and still have the tie to spock that was set up in season 1.,1
4085,the problem i have with this is the season better be a lot longer than the like 10-14 episode seasons the other shows are getting. the other problem is they better not waste a cool premise by strictly avoiding any serialization like voyager did.,1
4086,"well i don’t k ie what your understanding of the series was when you were 16.like did you get it’s themes or thought it was about picard, data and the borg like a focus group sample?",1

4088,"they listened to the fans (they bragging about this!) -- this idea is the thing i wanted to see back in trek for a long time.but i gotta admit, the style of these guys writing is not something i enjoy at all.",1

4090,"have experience with one novel and several short stories. as anyone will tell you - write and read regularly. notice what you like in the written word - this will impact what you end up with if you allow yourself the needed iterations to tune it in after initial writing.i don't like the planned, intentional plot, but the organic creative approach. there is a huge creative element in human brains to tap here. i suggest you start with something: a phrase, memory, picture, passionate experience and let that lead the first words in your story. invite your creative brain/soul (whatever it is) to take the next steps, asking - what is this about, where is this going? maybe there will be false starts. so what. in the end you will have something sweet like a part of yourself you cherish, and even if nobody else loves it, you certainly will.best of skill and creativity to you.",1
4091,"anakin was so powerful in the force that he was - probably unknowingly - bending padme to his will throughout episode 2 without even realizing it.  hence his complete surprise when she says she loves him, out of nowhere, as they entered the geonosis arena.  this also explains why she suddenly became a meek little waifu in episode 3, completely unlike her previous characterization, and how her spirit was broken when anakin betrayed and attacked her at on mustafar. granted, this is dark as hell, but it does sort out that whole broken subplot.",1
4092,"100% true....i love everything about this idea, i just have very little faith in the leadership.",1

4095,"writing is not a make-money-quick industry. the overwhelming majority of people who try, fail and the overwhelming majority of people who succeed have been doing it for many, many years. you can't decide to try and be good at it. the average author has written 6 complete novels before they ever come close to anything worth selling. it takes many years to get good at this. unfortunately for you, you do not have that experience nor can you get it in the next couple of months.if you want to write, then by all means write, but don't expect it to pay the bills. even people who have been selling books for decades, they often have to have a job and write on the side.",1

4102,yes. and then figure out how to make some made-up ending hook for the next season.,1
4103,"well this isn't surprising, they were kinda setting this up  as far as i'm concerned season 2 of discovery was akin to anime filler season and its real purpose was an ad for this new show.",1
4104,too much? c'mon man.,1
4105,"wtf?  dude, i don't like discovery either, but this analogy is bullshit.  the existence of a show that you don't enjoy, but other people do, is in no way like torturing animals.  that's a seriously fucked up comparison.long running franchises change over time.  it's just a fact of life.

4116,you would be miserable too if for example i'll go ahead and assume you like puppies right? well what if someone gave you a puppy and then they stomped on it's paw. the puppy whimpers in pain and they tell you no you're not allowed to help it. you just have to sit there and let it happen. you would be furious. that's how a lot of star trek fans feel right now.,1

4330,"the mote in god's eye( by larry niven and jerry pournelle. it's more  of a first contact novel, but there is a mystery there.larry niven also has a series of actual detective stories featuring gil hamilton, but it looks like you're looking for something _bigger_.stephen baxter's xeelee series can be thought of this way. what's the ring for? who are the xeelee? what's happening to our sun? these questions are all asked in his books, and are eventually answered.",1
4331,thanks for the recommendation.  would never have checked it out without this.  i'm on 4th or so ep... love bob odenkirk and always like john corbett (small role so far).,1
4332,the best way to know more about them is to look into hans giger art and scetches. it is educating in so many ways ),1
4333,"i just watched the film, thought it was amazing. generally the ""generation ship"" subgenre of sci-fi is what you are looking for. tau zero has a similar plot, if slightly different in tone. it's about a ship that suffers damage so it's unable to slow down. the freeze frame revolution is about deep time aboard a generation ship, where the inhabitants wake up for a handful of days every 10,000 years. this post is 5 months old so not sure if you'll read this, but if you want more recs let me know!",1

4338,"started watching it today after reading this post and, three episodes in, i'm totally blown away. thanks for the recommendation!",1
4339,"it ended on an unanswered question, but it was still satisfying.the one thing i didn’t like is that it leaned a bit too hard on the “is it superpowers or mental illness?” angle a little too hard when only the superpowers explanation makes sense given what other people say and how they react throughout the series.  after the security guard scene it’s really hard to make the case for mental illness unless you think everything is taking place in her head.  not to mention the big reveal flashback that is verified by a third party shorty afterward.",1
4340,great. thanks!,1

4343,"if you loved the show, you need to do yourself a favor and visit meow wolf( in santa fe, nm at some point (it's temporarily closed, due to covid).  george rr martin bankrolled it and undone felt like a tv version of it.  the stories are different, but they are very much within the same genre.plan on going three times for ~4 hours at a time to work through the whole thing.  more than 4 hours at a time and your brain is just overwhelmed.",1
4344,see my correction.,1
4345,i guess a rotoscoping animated show about schizophrenia and time traveling in a trippy ass format with native mexican ancestry is a bit too much for some people. i think fans of philip k dick would really like it.,1

4360,skip the sequels tho,1
4362,pilot episodes are notoriously all-over-the-place in order to either leave wiggle-room for network notes (can we make lucifer a cop somehow?) or sneak a plot point by the network (it's just like a police procedural and we definitely won't turn the world into a secret dystopia where two warring ais battle it out over the freedoms of humanity.)i'm sure there are other reasons.,1

4375,"another rotoscoping series to recommend - adult swim's dream corp llc. it's based in a rundown lab in an alternate universe where technology allows 'trained professionals' to visit each others dreams (purely in the name of science you understand!). seems similar to this where the rotoscoping kicks in for the dream sequences (and boy oh boy does it make use of that freedom of expression). featuring jon gries (uncle rico in napoleon dynamite) and the voice of stephen merchant (who you may know as another robot helper in portal 2), i can't recommend this series enough.

4387,the forever war maybe. not that relatable characters but not super heroes either.,1
4388,"amazing series with a really unusual plot told in a really interesting way.also interesting nice to see a sci-fi(?) show where the main character is a female poc, which isn't exactly a common thing at all.a season 2 is interesting, but i'm worried they'll fuck up what was a really good (if ambiguous) ending to a show which walked the line between sci-fi and metal illness with exquisite delicacy and even at the end never quite explicitly came down on either side.i have no idea how they write a whole new season without making one explanation or the other explicit (which instantly loses half of the appeal of the show), though.",1
4389,"man, enterprise s5 is going to be 🔥 when they get to the romulan war",1

4391,desperately hoping it's an anthology series.i'm not particularly worried though. the creator's episodes of bojack horseman are among the best.,1
4392,yeah it’s definitely a great series. i was instantly hooked because of the rotoscoping animation (which imo is very psychedelic) & it reminded me of the richard linklater films waking life & a scanner darkly. i’m personally a big fan of the rotoscoping animation style. i think it would be cool to have ones vision/sight like that honestly,1

4469,definitely the stars my destination by alfred bester. gritty revenge tale spanning a solar system.nova by samuel delany might qualify. it has some loftier ambitions but a lot of time is spent in the seedy underbelly of the galaxy with very flawed human characters. the centauri device by m. john harrison is about as close to a full-on noir star wars (noir wars?) as it is possible to get. big scale space opera but caked in grime and never shying away from the ugly side of things.,1

4485,"this is the saddest thing to me, because back in the mid 60s they took a big chance coming out with the original star trek show. there wasn't much on tv other than westerns and detective shows. sci-fi wasn't even really a genre on tv. they wanted to make something new and bold. they wanted to have futuristic concepts such as interracial relationships, women in powerful positions and science and peaceful diplomatic handling of situations. they added in a bit of that western action with some phaser blasts and good ol' fist fights and they had an instant hit on their hands.now, over half a century later, our studio executives can't be bothered to take that same chance. instead they just keep rehashing the same ol thing, hoping the super-fans will keep the franchise afloat based solely on nostalgia. and sadly they do most of the time.nostalgia in the 1600s -1700s used to be looked upon as a sickness. something that people longed for, home and familiarity... which impeded on growth and drive. a need to move forward and experience new things, to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man had gone before.nostalgia is a cage.",1

4639,"if you haven't seen it yet, anson mount was awesome as pike in discovery.",1

4642,"i just watched marco polo on netflix. it was very enjoyable, even though i knew he would eventually die, and kublai khan would eventually die.hopefully it's not a long story arc show. star trek needs to go back to being an episodic series.",1

4644,lmao. yeah. ewoks for the win,1
4645,"sure, given 1,000 years skynet could get ready for the borg.but then, given 1,000 years the ewok could get ready for the borg.",1
4646,i agree with pretty much everything you said.  one point of clarification:  there is no starfleet in _enterprise_.  t’pol just joined the crew of an earth vessel.,1
4647,"gibson gives the reader half the information and expects them to fill in the rest, which i prefer to some authors which explain things to death.",1
4649,cause the scene where they have all the parts on the table trying to figure out how to connect a square end to a round bit never happened.,1
4650,always thought the tos theme was pretty poor.,1
4651,makes sense. mhmm. how ya feel about the time travel thing? i remember in voyager the borg couldn't travel thru time but could send messages rather. you think skynet would even attempt space travel/exploration? maybe if skynet had a good 1000 years of development,1
4652,lots of possibilities: ,1
4653,"everything needs to be dark and gritty these days. i'm not opposed to stuff that's dark and gritty, but it's not what i admired about star trek. there's very little optimism or sense of wonder in the new stuff, and i feel like that was a keystone element of what roddenberry envisioned for trek.",1
4654,ridley scott confirmed that both alien and blade runner are in the same universe,1
4655,skynet couldn't even handle a group of ragtag sewer dwellers armed with rpg's and pickup trucks. the only thing it had going for it was the launch codes for the u.s nuclear arsenal; after the initial carnage of judgement day it was pretty much downhill.,1
4656,"guaranteed to fail, apparently cbs has no budget to hire good writers. if you start off with a bad script story, nothing will work.",1
4657,"yes, but the few times he showed emotions in tos after the pilot were the rare instances of intense emotions, or some other outside force essentially compromising his  outwardly emotionless demeanor.in the pilot episode he grins because some blue leaves on a plant make sounds.  it's clear the character was written differently once the show got picked up with shatner as kirk.   you get the impression he was originally curious and fascinated by  everything, but not necessarily the objective arbiter of logic over emotions that the character becomes.edit:  as for the kolinahr ritual, that happens after the missions of tos, not between the pilot and tos.",1
4658,i second this.  think there was  /s on that,1

4661,perhaps this story? ,1
4662,i still think one of ds9’s best episodes was the accidental time travel of quark’s shuttle to area 51...,1
4663,i can tell you right now the only thing we're exploring is a series of character cameos and the limits of nostalgia.,1
4664,sounds vaugely similar to the grebulon ship of mostly harmless (hitchhikers guide to the galaxy).,1
4665,haha remember when archer committed genocide on an entire species to start the prime directive? oh yes evolutionary this species is destined to continue evolving and won't be susceptible to the disease so let's commit genocide as the first instance of the prime directive. i like to think somewhere in the picard universe their species just gets on a ferengi vessel goes to the federation demands records of archer's logs  and goes crazy causing a federation wide incident.,1
4666,"both were great but pike was a bit magical. anson was so good looking that his role could have easily ended as cheesy/trashy, but instead he was just perfect. you just couldn't have enough of pike. he dominated every scene he was in. ethan peck gave spock a fresh new look - his spread eyes and deep voice especially.",1

4676,"this is it, right? the last chance?they have a good captain, they've got spock, they've got a good number 1. they've called the show strange new worlds.they need to go find innovative science fiction writers and pay them to write great stories for this show.fuck the continuity.just... fuck it. we'll all not care if they show up in orbit and make first contact with an intelligent and peaceful life form that needs assistance because the core of their gaseous planet is going to explode.",1
4677,"i don't entirely disagree with you, i just think that struggle is going in the opposite direction much of the time.  sisko head is that of a true believer federation man, but his heart is a bit closer to klingon warrior (and his tactics are a bit closer to being romulan).  he happily pounds backs with klingon warriors and joins them on their raids.  true, it is out of necessity that he does these things, but he isn't exactly kicking and screaming trying to find a way out.  picard would never look comfortable running a raid with a bunch of klingons behind enemy lines, sisko pretty clearly enjoys it.in fact, i think a lot of ds9 is sisko finding the space to sisko.  ds9, in the middle of political intrigue, war, and general chaos and mayhem is where sisko's skills really shine.  he walks the line between idealism and brutal pragmatism.  he is exactly the right man for the job, and he fills that role comfortably.  i don't think any federation captain could have existed in that time and place and done better than sisko.  personally, i think the end of a pale moon light is sisko, whose head is that of a true believer federation man, finds his heart is okay with what he did.  he is disturbed, but he is disturbed by the fact he even as his head scolds him, his heart is okay with it.  this man is not struggling with his heart( and that is what disturbs him the most.",1
4678,why can't they make a show that's post-ds9/voyager? i personally don't want to see a new spock/pike/picard/insert existing character in st universe arc. seems lazy.,1
4679,"this . . . makes perfect sense.  humanity achieves warp drive basically in the middle of a post-war apocalypse.  that's probably highly irregular compared to most civilizations.  the vulcans pretty much had to help rehab earth before fully admitting them to the federation.maybe that's the divergence point for the mirror universe?  earth achieves warp drive after wwiii, but never makes contact with the vulcans.  some post-war faction gains control of warp technology, weaponizes it, and 100+ years later the terran empire starts burning across the galaxy.",1
4680,agreed... and i understand totally why they are making this show after seeing season 2 of dis. what i don't understand is how/why they are making a season 3... they wrapped things up pretty tight at the end of season 2.,1
4681,"yeah but that's exactly the point i think... it wasn't the same enterprise, despite sharing the name. this new show is a complete re-hash of the same ship and almost the same crew as the original series. tng at least made something new out of it and explored new characters, new timelines, etc.",1
4682,"the way they tied everything up with a pretty bow at the end of discovery season 2, i'm surprised to hear they are going ahead with a 3rd season... not that i'm bothered by it, i enjoyed season 2 quite a bit!  plenty of twists and turns.  i'm just not sure how they're planning to continue it, narratively... this spin-off makes total sense though.",1
4683,can we get berman and braga back? i never thought i'd miss their tenure.,1
4684,yes?  that's what i wrote:i simply said that some people are of the opinion that star trek 2009 is a bad example. i didn't say that they go around yelling that in people's faces.,1

4695," 3) they have no idea how to write interesting stories in a bright world...in short, they don't get sci fi.they understand why humdrum addiction, social inequality, blackmail is interesting.but they don't understand why encounters with crazy weird alien stuff and having the limits of reality thrashed is interesting.",1

4711,"you misunderstand. its not that other characters didnt get screen time or development, no, there's a reason all of them are better developed than burnham after all. its that the plot of the show and the in universe events almost supernaturally revolves revolves around her. i mean, when the second season started and the mystery about what the signals and angels began, i couldnt be the only one who called it immediately from the start what its gonna revolve around ? and that permeates the entire series, making it predictable and lame.",1

4718,"anthology seasons can be pulled off with any number of episodes. that's not the issue. the problem is that kurzman et al can't write.1) they can't write compelling characters to keep viewers coming back, so they need to put them in a wild fast-paced twisty story arc, where the stakes are always high and the suspense is unrelenting.2) they don't know how to build a hard sci-fi world that is consistent, so anytime the plot/information given does not make sense according to the established lore, or even with the events the series portrayed itself, the pace picks up. the fast pace doesn't let the audience realize the glaring inconsistencies they are presented with. you can't do fast-pace in an anthology, where you need to spend half an episode every time to build up whatever situation the crew will end up facing in the other half.3) they have no idea how to write interesting stories in a bright world. star trek takes place in a world where there are barely any problems. the characters are generally not plagued by guilt, work stress, bad bosses, rivals, abusive relationships, poverty, disabilities, prejudices or anything else you would find in almost any other series/film. therefore, in traditional star trek, the characters don't have the usual boundaries and conflicts they need to overcome (that's the genius of star trek, and why it's so refreshing and original). the current writers have no idea how to go about this, so they turned the world grim, and gave characters all the usual trope issues to resolve: addiction, social inequality, blackmail, injustice, conspiracy, favors to friends/enemies, ptsd, bad memories, cynicism, corrupted leadership, political backstabbing etc.",1

4732,well when you put it that way...,1
4733,those are some of my favorite episodes. like when quark finds out the grand nagus is dating his mom and they keep beaming into his closet for some reason. it’s not a good thing when our sci fi always has to take itself seriously all the time.the episodic nature lets us have personality and fun with the characters.,1

4768,"but the fact that his edition of trek reignited interest should inspire confidence. the people who want more nemesis and insurrection aren’t what keeps this fan base growing, just like people who wanted kirk and spock instead of picard and riker weren’t going to keep the fan base growing.ten year olds who were introduced to stxi are 21 now, and the success of disco and picard are testament that there is a fan base.",1
4769,"wtf is it with prequels. it goes against the core of st, voyage into the uknown. lazy, scared execs and writers",1

4775," discovery and picard don't seem to have time to explore an idea for its own sake, which is the heart of good science-fiction and good star trek.that really captures my feelings with regards to these series, in a way that i couldn't quite articulate.  thank you!",1

4798,same here. i had a hard time visualizing a lot of the characters. i checked online for illustrations and fan art and that really gave me better sense of the characters.,1
4799,rebecca romijn is a terrible actress so this should be interesting.  i tried watching her in the librarian and it was cringe worthy.  her face barely moves because of the botox or whatever she's had done.,1

4804,this is a truly insane take.,1
4805,"well each show has their own set of writers. kurtzman and goldsman seem to be guiding the overall plan. michelle paradise is now showrunning discovery, chabon did picard season 1, jenny lumet seems like she's that person here.",1
4806,"neuromancer and the rest of his early work can be a really hard read. i don't have any great advice beyond, do your best. his later work is much better written, and even enjoyable to read. pattern recognition, idoru, etc are like night and day for writing style. don't give up on gibson based of the sprawl.",1
4807,"discovery's second season did this a little more, but always in service of the main arc.  the kelpian episode was probably the closest they've come to a classic trek episode.  discovery and picard don't seem to have time to explore an idea for its own sake, which is the heart of good science-fiction and good star trek.",1

4820,"i liked star trek discovery but i don't know if i ""pay cbs seven bucks a month"" liked it.  the writing and tone was inconsistent episode to episode. additionally they very lazily relied on outrageous, miraculous applications of technology to fix almost everything that was much closer to fanasy than sci-fi.  that being said i really liked the cast and it was visually appealing.  what they really need is more michelle yeoh.  i think she stole every scene.",1

4823,who says i'm paying....,1
4824, old trekreal trek. some say( nutrek is the way it is due to the licensing agreement that required the new franchise to be significantly different so it can sell merchandise that doesn't compete with real-trek merchandise.,1
4825,"sorry i haven't had time to answer until now.agreed about security, the behavior on the ship is very unprofessional in general, but they're clearly not held to the same standards as nasa in our time. likely a consequence of technological progress leading to complacency, along with privatization. don't remember the liftoff.i didn't know the show was cancelled, so i just watched it not knowing what to expect, and when i got to the end i was happy with it. not amazed, but it was fine, the journey was what mattered. like i said, the questions, what science/fiction is all about. didn't think another season was needed, but i could see the possibility of one.you don't think this reached the general audience, on netflix? or that anything futuristic/with a decent budget/adapted from grrm books in current year would? how come i couldn't find the typical nerd stuff critic channels on yt reviewing it, or anyone? i fear it may have only reached the general audience.i don't like horror either, unless it's in already interesting scifi, and this kept me interested (and it wasn't all that much horror either). but stupid characters aren't a bad thing by default, only if they're uncharacteristically stupid or if the writers made them stupid without understanding it. i haven't really experienced that here. only expandable grunt stupidity, madness, and various overpowering/blinding flaws, but nothing that pulled me out.maybe i'm not as clever as i think i am, but that's how i felt.edit: some elaboration.",1
4826,"the writing is hit-or-miss for sure, but i think the format is part of the problem.  tos, tng, etc. had 25+ episodes per season.  they had time to do anthology-style one-off episodes while also developing characters and following story arcs.  streaming series run 8-13 episodes per season, usually focused on one or two major arcs.  ""bingeable"" television with little time for side stories.  for a franchise like star trek, with its history and continuity, the short-form is very dissatisfying.  my favorite episode of picard was when he spent a day with riker and troi.  it made me so happy to see them living as a family.  and so much backstory and history was hinted at for them and their kids, but there was barely time to explore any of it.  it was a hook for a future spin-off.  what we used to call a ""back door pilot"".  except, half the series was spin-off hooks!",1

4830,"yeah, ... please go to watch orville please and leave us alone.",1
4831,"but we tried that and we got a pretty crappy picard. !spoiler  i had super high hopes for the show but it was horribly written, there were so many senseless story lines and characters which were half explored and had no impact on the story. elnor could have been cut entirely with no impact on the story. the whole series so far has basically been about introducing new characters which don't matter and then shock value of bringing established characters into the story for limited screen time. it's lazy writing, last 3 episodes we're given a brand new character who ends up being the antagonist (as if that wasn't something we didn't see coming). or shitty, lazy and cheap cg, lets roll up with 80 ships in a fleet, all of which are the exact same class. or even the borg cube that crashes into the planet in the final few episodes, somehow something of that size doesn't cause an extinction level event... or even dust for that matter. the sky is crystal clear after it crashes, you'd think that there'd be atleast some dust right? !<say what you will about discovery's action, but atleast they were able to develop characters which you cared about.

4870,"there's like no logic to what you're saying. they're good writers who have some bad projects on their resumes, not the other way around. shit writers don't just magically come up with the occasional good script. it's much easier to explain how a project can turn to shit when, like i said, the process of making a movie or show involves way more people than just the initial writer. there are a lot of shit writers out there no doubt but it's rare for them to get into sustained positions of power in hollywood without having at least some talent. shit writers don't win oscars for their scripts, they don't create and write on a top tier show like fringe for multiple seasons. of course it's way easier to pick stuff that you don't like and think isn't good and point to the writing. the internet is a generally negative place and that's scapegoating 101.i think guys like goldsman and kurtzman are just more comfortable taking hits on their resumes to work on ip they like. like i explained, batman & robin is a perfect example of that. a studio hires you to write a batman movie, you do a generally good job so they want another one, but now they want it in half the time and you might not have a great idea for it, but you're under contract and on a deadline and you're also working on other projects you've moved on to. so you turn in a subpar script and it only proceeds to get further mangled when they cast the hot doctor from er as the dark knight and a loud austrian mr. universe as the usually subdued and troubled ice scientist. of course it's going to go to shit. and i bet every one of those movies and episodes you hate have similar stories. but it's easier to just say the writer sucks. that's a simple heuristic response for your brain to make rather than looking at the situation critically.",1

4887,they were also (spoilers) a different faction and different philosophically than the dominant faction during tos and tng times. one that disapproved of mind melds and was downright hawkish in its military stance.

4911,"just a thought here.  authors take a bad rap for doing too much of what they call “exposition”.  breaking down a simplified narrative for the reader that lays a foundation for interpreting the rest of the story.  from a creative standpoint exposition is considered a freshman technique for storytelling.  it limits the imagination of the reader and narrows interpretation down to the views that the author has created through the exposition.  i think gibson is purposefully avoiding almost any exposition in neuromancer as a creative tool that at one end will likely turn off readers that don’t feel comfortable making the imaginative leap required to engage with the story and  at the same time open the work for age enduring interpretations.  this is part of the reason neuromancer is relevant today.  my advice would be to keep plowing and let gibson’s story speak to you as a whole and not get caught up in needing a proscribed narrative at each step of the journey.  it takes some discipline but imho gibson pays it out by the end of the story.  neuromancer is the foundation for so much of what we accept as given background for this genre.  he is an explorer in uncharted waters with this book, see his undiscovered country for what it is and perhaps the sense of wonder will grow as he describes his visions.",1
4912,"the opposite is true though. it's easy to pick out the fringe and a beautiful mind.but it's way easier to pick out episodes of picard, i robot, i am legend (which is still crap with either ending), angels and demons, lost in space, rings, the dark tower, etc.it's a lot of bad stuff.not saying people don't surprise you. we've had bangers from the most random of folks in the past. but i'm not stoked.",1
4913,"i guess i just have a soft spot for screenwriters. like look at damon lindelof, dude's created three of the best shows of all time and his last two are nearly perfect. but he gets so much shit because people hated the end of lost and a couple of his movies. i think he's proven he wasn't completely at fault for those and that he's better than what might be his worst work.as for discovery, it's an odd show. remember that it started as a bryan fuller show and he was fired during production on the first season (something that's happened several times since with him). then they had to fire the next set of showrunners because they were abusing the writers. i think by the end of season 2 they finally got the show to where the current batch of writers wanted it and finally steered the ship into the right direction, it was just a bumpy road. but i think there's a lot of good in there. the cast and performances are really good, there are bright spots with some of the more self-contained sci fi stuff they've delved into (the beta quadrant town that go moved from earth, the kelpian/ba'ul drama, the stuff with the sphere, even the giant tardigrade stuff and how they treated the mycelial network). there's good shit there and they'll be unencumbered in season 3 without having to deal with the fact that they're in the past and using a technology that technically shouldn't exist at that time.",1
4914,"they should write-in some random explanation for spock's big, goofy smile from the tos pilot.  ",1

4923,anson mount as pike became a great starfleet captain in record time in my opinion. i’m very excited to see more,1
4924,i want a sulu series.,1
4925,"neither will i. i just use cinemahd and local cast. i find a show i want to watch, let it find the stream i want to cast, then it asks me to ""open with..."" i chose local cast and cast it... it's free and all i have to do is wait til the next day after the episode aired... movies tend to take a little while longer for a good quality stream... i wish showbox was still operational though. it was much better at doing the same thing 😔",1
4926,"goldsman also won an oscar for a beautiful mind and wrote a bunch on fringe. kurtzman co-created fringe, worked on other good shows like alias, sleepy hollow. he wrote star trek 09, the first transformers, mi3 which i think are all pretty good.it's easy to cherrypick from people's filmographies and focus on the bad. writers tend to get a bad rap in this regard. if something fails it seems to me like the writers tend to get the most shit for it, but they're like the first step in the process and usually a movie or show doesn't get the go ahead without a good script. from there it's not that hard to fuck up a movie between studio notes, rewrites, punch-ups, filming, editing, post-production, etc. i'm not saying these two writers share no blame for why the movies you mentioned sucked but looking at all of the situations individually you could probably identify other factors. like batman & robin had a bunch of problems. it was fast-tracked after batman forever did well and goldsman and schumacker had to write it while they were already working on a time to kill. they also had bad casting thrust on them (clooney and arnold) and that didn't fit with what they were going for (a campy throwback to the 60s show). just as an example.",1

4929,"huh. you got the impression that humans were the top species in tos, eh? interesting. i'm seeing a lot of agreement with you here. i never got that impression. like, there was a lot of talk about how humans are great because they love and because they have information and because they have kindness and stuff like that, but technologically, it seemed like other races had cloaking devices, not us. and everyone could warp and transport. and other races had their own regions and politics. like, the central message of the show seemed to be that we were morally superior but 'top species?' i'm really interested in hearing that.",1
4930,"actually, quite a lot of people care about star trek. they like the thoughtfulness it provokes in them, they grow attached to the characters, they're exhilarated by its action sequences, and they love the escapism of this universe.lots of people care about star trek.i care.the majority of this sub probably cares.i think you care too, since you're here, after all.:)",1

4938,"a good way to get into this series, and discovery, is through the short trek episodes. i really had no interest in this incarnation of star trek, but i found myself watching those one day and i found them pretty entertaining.  i still don't buy spock having a sister, though.",1

4940,"humans end up being the glue that unites other nations due to being mutable and not too far stuck in one aspect. they earn the trust and respect of a bunch of other species who can't bridge the gaps in their differences. our ability to be flexible and empathize with all these various extremes creates a culture of sharing that allows us to eventually surpass them. it's not that implausible that a fledgling nation could be so neutral that it can take from all sides and eventually catch up to or even surpass ones that were ahead of it. the longer the star trek universe goes on we need to try and explain more and more the various reasons all these alien societies fit together despite so many of them being extreme to a fault. vulcans with their obsession over logic and being unable to control their emotions. klingons as technological vikings obsessed with death and glory. these were all shallow concepts tos could get away with barely scratching the surface of. as time goes on, someone needs to try and give them all depth and it's no easy job. i honestly think enterprise did an ok job at sort of showing how human ingenuity and our ability to adapt quickly helped us win favor and rise quickly. it was by no means a perfect show but i think it rose to the challenge of trying to give more explanation to the early days of human space exploration.",1
4941,"enterprise showed us that the strength humans bring to the table is our diversity, which makes us more tolerant of -- and able to work with -- the diverse alien species out there. and humans used that unifying strength to bring together the more technologically advanced founding members of the federation. at no point in enterprise were humans technologically superior to vulcans. how we benefitted them was with the ""soft skills"" (and risk tolerance) that vulcans notoriously lack.because humans are the unifying force of the federation, it makes sense that hq would be on earth, and that it would be staffed with many/mostly (local) humans. it also makes sense that ships whose primary mission is to ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" would be primarily human. as that is the mission of the flagship enterprise, i can see why tos would give off that impression (of human superiority). remember, the enterprise (once tos put it in the federation instead of the united earth) was built from human and vulcan and andorian and tellarite (and whoever else had joined by that point) technology. humans didn't ""surpass"" anyone.i'll finish with a non-canon argument i saw on reddit, which is that though we see mainly human ships on tv, there are just as many ships that are mostly vulcan or mostly andorian etc. because each species has different biological requirements (temperature, humidity, air composition etc), it makes sense to cluster them on ships where everyone can be comfortable (and work optimally) on a given environmental control setting.",1
4942,did anyone have a problem with that aspect of enterprise? i didnt. i just got kind of bored with it.,1

4962,"so i had this issue with neuromancer when i first read it many years ago. on a reread, i have some thoughts. i’ll be brief as possible.yes, gibson is playing a game of relatively literary style with a massive amount of cyberpunk world building mashed in there. it is frankly, hard to follow. style and genre are mixing violently. if you look at, say, snow crash, the two are in harmony. i, as the reader, pay as little or as much attention to any detail as the narrator/pov character(s).but (a big but, and i like big buts), on my reread i noted something very important that my massive experience with psychedelics between reads revealed. case is broken, like badly broken, via a forced dose of supermushrooms. despite the various things which mitigate this in the neuromancer world, it is pervasive and effective.so, yes, we get a choppy, disjointed narrative from a pov character who often seems fixated on the wrong things or lost in his own head—because he is. his brain has been systematically broken with drugs and is held together by glorified duct tape. of course his story makes no sense.so it’s either a brilliant stylist choice or yes, gibson’s style is impenetrable for no reason. i can’t say for sure.",1

4969,"honestly, this has been my experience with gibson. and to be clear, i love neuromancer, the rest of the sprawl trilogy, bridge trilogy, etc. but he doesn't do a lot of explanation or explication through the text, so stuff can be hard to follow until you've steeped in the world for a little bit, but by about a quarter or a third into it, in my experience, stuff picks up and is easier to follow. same with ian mcdonald's stuff, as well.i'm not going to tell you to keep reading it if you're enjoying it, but i had a similar experience on starting neuromancer, and really ended up hooked by the end.",1

5043,"alright! now we're talking. i see your point about matt, and i have had this discussion with others. to me the three (rand, perrin and matt) were wusses and that was the idea. that's how the author characterised them in my eyes. if you felt something different, cheers. on the argument about the fight and how he had to end it quickly, well i mean... unless it was oven more contrived he would have had to beat one then the other, and using a polearm would tire you less than a sword and armour (your own argument). reality is... and i know you don't like it, but matt won because and just because. he's a greater friend of the author and an mc than the other two and the moment felt cool and adventurous. something akin to what you would see in an anime-type story or a fairytale. which is why it was ridiculous to me. also, if this is the height of the series then the series does not go very high.",0

5059,"not a lot of fantasy fare from france, sadly.of course, we have some asterix adaptations. if you’re american maybe you don’t know asterix, but it’s the best-selling comic book series in the rest of the world. it’s about gaulish warriors fighting the roman invasion with the help of a superstrength-granting magic potion. it’s a comedy done in a cartoony style, with a lot of clever puns and wordplays.  the last two asterix computer-animated movies are good (the mansion of the gods and the secret of the magic potion). in fact, as a rule the animated adaptations generally are, the live action ones are not (don’t bother).we do have one fantasy tv show, it's called kaamelott and it’s very good. it's a comedy (at first, then it becomes a dramedy) about king arthur and the knights of the round table. very funny and the creator of the show knows his fantasy stuff. at least the first seasons (out of six) were subtitled in english, but honestly i can't guarantee the series stays good watching it that way. most of the humor comes from the dialogues and different slangs and would be a lot of work to translate correctly (a bit like asterix).  not fantasy tv shows but of interest: nicolas le floch (murder mysteries in the time of louis xv), hero corp (superhero comedy), and le visiteur du futur (time travel comedy, subtitled episodes are available on the series website).  the historical novel series the accursed kings (les rois maudits), famously one of g. r. r. martin’s main inspirations for asoiaf, was also adapted as an event series twice. the 1970s version is a classic, but can feel like a filmed play. the 2000s version has good actors, but they made the bizarre choice of asking famous sf comics author druillet to design the interior sets, and only the interior sets, which can be a bit jarring.the upcoming netflix series la révolution looks promising. it’s a fantasy horror reimagining of the french revolution built around a mysterious blue blood.  movie-wise, we have a very good ""almost fantasy"" movie in brotherhood of the wolf. it's a stylized historical action horror movie about the infamous beast of gévaudan which killed hundreds of people during the 18th century. not really fantasy, but the spirit is there. the director later went on doing an actual fantasy movie: an adaptation of beauty and the beast. this one isn’t without problems, but it has great sets and a stone giant, so...one of our national specialties is animation, so that’s where you can find most of our fantasy movies.a monster in paris, kaena: the prophecy, the rain children, babar: king of the elephants, dragon hunters, the king and the mockingbird (a.k.a. the curious adventure of mr. wonderbird), mune: guardian of the moon, pachamama, the red turtle, phantom boy, the little prince, zombillenium come to mind.the animated movies of michel ocelot are always interesting. he did the kirikou trilogy (inspired by african fairy tales, there is non sexual nudity if you need warning), azur & asmar (inspired by 1001 nights), tales of the night (fairy tales rendered in silhouettes), and dilili in paris (period adventure).  i will add more later.",0

5082,"  the bulk of the plot is about rescuing thomas, which is generic action hero stuff rather than a detective story.and even that was pretty lame. like if you're going to have a heist story make it better than ""sneak down the laundry chute then use magic potion to walk out the front door."" maybe if there were consequences to that which might be in the next book but probably not because nobody will give a shit about thomas with everything else going on.",0
5083,"well, with a real fear, it can create more negative associations with the thing you're afraid of if you do it wrong. but for something like this, if you stick with books you're pretry sure you'll enjoy or at least not dislike, i'd say your odds of success are better. and if it goes wrong, nothing will have really changed. if you're actually afraid of bad covers, that's different, of course.(i hate spiders too.)",0

5099,"as a counterpoint to most of the praise here: i'm on the third book of the series and finding it a terrible slog.  i thought the first book was fine, but the only reason i kept reading was because of how people rave about the amazing ending.the books are _extremely_ plot driven and thick with infodumps about the magic system and the backstory.  (if i were generous i'd call the backstory ""intricate"", but ""convoluted"" would fit too.)  coupled with the fact that i never really warmed up to the characters, this led to a lot of skimming on my part as i tried to read past all the exposition to get to the good stuff.  the magic system is so mechanical that it doesn't really feel magical at all.  there _are_ some good twists now and then, but i was never really invested enough to appreciate them.for context: i _like_ cool magic and epic conflicts in my stories, but i _need_ good characters and relationships.

5182,"thanks for the comment. so, i can see how two contrasting features can be present in the same person. the two contrasts are also really well conveyed by abraham. however, the switch between the contrasts isn't seamless enough for my taste in the case of geder or cithrin.  for example, when geder kills dawson and then immediately tries to woo cithrin, i can totally understand what abraham was aiming for. however, to me, there's a certain nuance of psychopathy that just went unexplored in that moment. it would have really elevated my connection with the character. after the burning of vanai, i can understand how geder could blame others for his decision, but the character-work that preceded that moment somehow led me to believe there'd be some turbulent internal monologue on geder's part to justify burning 10,000 people. instead, we get a couple of references to the incident in geder's prose and we move on. it could work if geder were jorg from the prince of thorns, but he isn't. only a character that was incredibly callous with the lives of thousands would behave like that. and i just couldn't see geder being that kind of person.cithrin's contrasts gel better than those of geder's but it's easier to overlook the gaps since they're not as central to the plot (as yet) compared to geder's due, in part, to how ordinary marcus' arc has been.  once again, the contrasts in her behavior are clear to me, but at moments the shift can be a little jarring.",0

5280,"sanderson is the obvious answer, but honestly most authors who churn out books at a tremendous pace (king for exemple) tend to have poor prose. i'm of the opinion that most people can write a beautiful string of sentences given enough time, and authors simply use that method on a much larget scale. it's no surprise that people like guy gavriel kay or patrick rothfuss, who are known for their very flowery proses, are also some of the slowest writers as well. on the flipside, having a simplistic prose does not make it bad, it's simply another style. one of my go-to exemple is michael j sullivan's ryiria revelations series, it's an extremely simple prose style that perfectly fits the story told. the prose carries the reader seamlessly from one point to the other, never noticeable. and unnoticeable is exactly what a simple prose should strive to be. no matter how you personally prefer your style of prose to be, if a book's prose pulls you out of the immersion, be it by too many repetitions of the same words or expressions, by very poor dialogues or by a really overdone metaphor, then it's doing a poor job.",0

5307,"i'll echo the feeling of how disjointed it seemed. to copy from what i put in gr, it really reminded me of one of those reunion episodes where plot keeps getting interrupted by cameos and scene changes to cram in everyone we've ever met before, and a lot of it doesn't really contribute to anything - this is the shortest book in a long time and yet it felt like it needed to trim down. i could kind of get the motivation for how ebenezer was acting, but it's like right out the gate he behaves so differently from every time we've seen before, and all to serve building to this big fight, that then has no stakes because it resolved with a deus ex machina. so, i guess both good and bad that it felt like there were a bunch of points butcher knew he wanted to get us to, but it felt inorganic and convoluted all the details of how we got there.i was probably unreasonably bothered by the wardens so adamantly demanding to know who harry had sex with, as if wardens have to check in every time they get laid or his conflicts of interest require him to do so yet somehow don't exclude him from being a warden in the first place. it just felt dumb and another way to be real weird about sex. which, yea, anything sexual still weird/awkward af in this book.i'm also kind of bothered that this built up a whole huge thing about how just obscenely horrible it is seeing thomas so drained, when we heard right from the beginning that is basically what they are going to choose to put justine through and like no real big objections to that?we also didn't get any huge losses, so i assume those are coming. harry kept heavy handedly reminiscing about how life was so easy before he had people, and how much he missed his home/lab. we got the home/lab tie-in in this one, and then obviously the wedge between him and gramps, but i wonder how much/who he is going to lose in battle ground.oh also, not for the first time he seems to think fancy events have buffets. is this a thing? i don't think it is a thing? i may be wrong?",0

5425,"i have to disagree.           i think the core issue with your assessments is that your looking at the situations as allegories for specific issues and situations. and in those comparisons the following themes and messages have some very problematic connotations. but only because of the precedent and comparison you yourself set. not because of whats actually in the books.            for clarity the biggest example here is you pointing to mistborn as a clear allegory for american slavery. i dont think thats a fair assessment at all. i think it breaks down the issues with slavery as a whole, humanizes slaves, and shows things like generational trauma rational assumptions, etc. and the issues with them. because it covers this issue well it works as an allegory for american slavery... or slavery in the middle east... or asian slavery... or russian and european feudalism... etc. the important note is that sanderson has made his situations have significant differencrs to make it clear the messages womt be 1:1 transferable. eugenics wasnt implemented successfully in a systematic and purposeful way in american slavery. the actual augmenting on a genetic level in mistborn serves to make it clear that this is a different fantastical situation. any theme or message looked at should be with the understanding of this difference.           when rasheks described as a good guy that did these things i dont believe the message is that thesr arent disqualifiers from being a good person. its that a good person can do evil things. that they can become an evil person. and the journey can start and continue with good intentions. i thought the story adequately stressed that while even evil rashek was trying to save the world, his actions as lord ruler were evil. but he did these things not becausr a good person could make these mistakes, but because he had a force of nature, a literal devil, manipulating what he saw felt and and who he was. that he would never have done these things without the influence of ruin. that these were the evil things a force of ruin would have someone do. eugenics, rape, slaughter were the actions that defined rashek the well intentioned as a person corrupted and influenced. and the story of skaa success and perspective was meant to clarify that these were flawed ideals and goals. to really stress that the actions of the wannabe savior are only not justifiable but not effective. this is a message that i appreciate because we dont need to teach most people hitler was bad. most know that. we need to teach people that think eugenics makes sense but were used evilly or that minoritys need to be saved instead of empowered that thesr machinations are just as wrong as the people whove used them, are wrong in any situation, and dissuade people from the white savior complex thats much more common than abject racism. and i dont think sanderson wrote it with this goal, but i think the effects of him writing these situations without mirroring specific situations makes it applicable in great ways like this. all of the issues you bring up as having problematic implications are problematic in the worlds and plots where he writes them. they shouldnt be applied as specific messages to real world situations with a bunch of variables. if we look at lopen as a capable handicapped character, and a super hero who grew back lubs than both of thosr are great. we can be better people by espousing those concepts. if we try to apply it to the real world you can get the message that hadicapped people cant be superheros, but the worlds sanderson writes are so dramatically different that it encourages not doing that. this is just the story of one strong handicapped character. and the concept of superheroes in stormlight is that they become them by first being broken and persevering. the whole idea of the radiants is to empower those who feel broken. if we just look at that message and not the situation as a whole, even his superheroes are empowering to the disabled. dalinar has memory issues. shallan is developing multiple pursonality disorder (but im still finsihing oathbringer and seeing whats happening). if we focus on the singular messages i dont see either series as espousing negative acts. i just think they feature them in a way that adds more nuance to the struggles his characters and even worlds as a whole face.            that got rambly and roughly formatted but i hope it brought something to the table to think about at the least.",0

5430,"there is a legendary creature called the fairy melusine, who goes back centuries; generally she is not bad, but over time it is easy for mythological characters to change their nature! sometimes melusine becomes melusina or melisande/melisandre. so modern fantasy writers very often dig around in the treasure chest of legendary creatures for the names for their characters, to save making up new ones...and because the old names have a resonance that has carried down over the years.",0

5446,"i'll repeat what i've said before - not a good book regardless of the next one. it's disjointed with plot overruling the character, lara being the main victim. she acts completely differently 3 times we meet her, and acts during the first evening of talks completely opposite of what she said at the gym. last confrontation on the island and motivation for lara being furious feels completely tackled on - suddenly she thinks harry doesn't care for thomas at all and wants to kill him?and it happens with all characters - they all act differently when before. and it doesn't get acknowledged by main hero. also there are many smaller moments in the book that feel like an author didn't reread his series before writing this one - the names are there, but details and some characterization misses the mark.another big issue for me was a lack on drive - whole ""i've got to save thomas"" wasn't engaging, and the secondary storyline (at least for this book) of peace talks was much more interesting, probably because it advances main plot, and rescuing thomas is plot we've experienced before several times already. so this lack of drive leads to the book feeling like it's another ghost story - an overblown collection of scenes with some encounters that could have been edited out and with leftover essentials written in shorter form.and i was also annoyed by ramped up sex theme - reminded me of direction anita blake went in past obsidian butterfly, but to a lesser degree. and sexualization of underage girls didn't help either (for those who don't understand and say that it's normal, whole characterization only two female teenagers in the book was ""she's named this, does this, here's a sign of her sexual maturity"", so it's about ratio, not only the fact itself).and before ""you just didn't like it because there was no ending"", no, i don't care about that, i knew there would be a second part anyway. i like serialized storytelling when it's done well. this book uses usual storytelling instruments, but does it mostly unsuccessfully, and feels like it lacks soul",0

5490,"i'll say this, though: abercrombie's writing skills have improved immensely since the blade itself. it makes sense, the guy gets better as a writer as he writes more and more. i don't know if he has a better editor as well? but red country (for example) is much, much better in terms of writing, pacing and storytelling versus blade itself.not disagreeing with the sentiments here... it's probably best to start at the beginning. just keep in mind that (imo, at least) his writing gets progressively better and better. so if you have issues with the first couple books, those issues might not appear in all of his writing.i almost stopped reading best served cold as it was overly long, and got repetitive and the entire thing was scattered feeling. by red country, his writing and general construction of the novel was just immensely better.i've generally enjoyed everything of his that i've read. just want to put this out there for you.",0

5570,"warlock has some dark connotations. magician has modern connotations of someone doing party tricks. but really, there's no specific meaning attached to them. there's no connection to social rank or cultural background in any way, imo. in some stories witches are the typical kind of evil, potion brewing magical people that eat children. in some, it has more wicca vibes. and then you have harry potter witches, which is just the female version of wizard. in c.s. friedman's magister trilogy, witches were weaker magic users that mostly had to rely on gestures, words and such to do magic, and their magic was called witchery (which covered everything from healing to shapeshifting and throwing balls of fire). magisters were much more powerful magic users, and they used sorcery (but were not really called sorcerers).you can go d&d style and say that wizards tend towards having to learn by study ... but then you have something like ""hedge wizard"" which you see here and there, with the implication that these are magic users that learnt things on their own or from passed down knowledge, rather than in a formal educational setting.but then you also have the witcher books, in which all magic users are called sorcerers/sorceresses, and they very much go to learn magic at prestigious academies and study for years, even centuries, and use all kinds of magic.and there's the classic riftwar saga, where the protagonist when to study magic with a magician, who was a typical high fantasy magic user.so really, at the end of the day, it just comes down to what sounds the coolest to every individual author.",0

5666,"i think ""the new weird"" ended up being more a marketing term and a general statement of anti-tolkien, anti-epic fantasy sentiment than a genre with definite aesthetic boundaries, though many of the works categorized as ""new weird"" tend to be grotesque, decadent, and dreamlike. imagine if borges or calvino were writing contemporary genre novels. new weird writers saw mervyn peake rather than tolkien as their progenitor; their settings tended to break out of the cod-medieval mode that had become the norm in fantasy; their settings were often urban rather than pastoral; their politics tended to be left-wing. the standout new weird novels are:the etched city by kj bishop: part western, part 19th century french symbolism, this novel follows the lives of a doctor and a mercenary, both of whom fought on the losing side of a revolution, as they make their way through a strange and decadent city.perdido street station by china mieville: the new weird's hottest club is perdido street station. this one's got everything: bird people, insect people, frog people, a woman whose head is a beetle, a multidimensional spider, giant moths that eat your dreams, and the crappiest crapsack city imaginable. read anything by china mieville if you're interested in the new weird.palimpsest by catherynne m. valente: another novel set in a weird, often grotesque, city. i love the narrative voice of this one.city of saints and madmen by jeff vandermeer: not really a novel but a collection of stories set in another weird, quasi-victorian decadent city. worth it for the first novella (dradin in love) alone.if you want to venture into more experimental prose, check out the works of michael cisco.if you want a more straightforwardly epic fantasy feel, check out the year of our war by steph swainston.the iron dragon's daughter by michael swanwick predates the new weird moniker, but it is definitely new weird-adjacent.the omnibus edition of viriconium by m. john harrison came out around the time ""new weird"" was becoming a thing, and harrison is the one who coined the term, so i would check this out even though some of the works collected here are as old as the 70s and 80s. you'll definitely see his influence all over new weird stuff.",0

5681,"- _damselle in distress_ by kiley kellermeyer is a take on fairy tales (damselle's ""superpower"" is that she constantly needs saving. it's funny. trust me.)- anything discworld, but particularly the night watch series is right up your alley here- most of the dragonlance novels from the 90s would fit the bill. i haven't read much dragonlance in the last 15 years, so i can't speak to more recent novels.- _the land of dis_ series, starting with _disenchanted_, by robert kroese is pretty funny. it's satirical and humorous. the main character, boris the implacable, is... well, ""implacted""... on the first page, and his ghost has to pull his dead body around for the rest of the book and recruit help to free his soul. it's pretty good. in fact, i'd say any of kroese's books are the kind of light-hearted fantasy that you're talking about.- doesn't really fit the ""different races"" thing, but almost anything by lindsay buroker fits the rest of your requirements. her first series, _the emperor's edge_, is a small cast of characters on a funny, snarky, sometimes serious, sometimes absurd adventures. she's also got about 40 books out, so there's plenty to read here. they're almost all available on audible, as well. can't speak highly enough of buroker and her works.- kill the farmboy, by kevin hearne and delilah s. dawson, is a satirical adventure about... well, a farmboy and a chosen one and the dark lord toby and... it's funny! there's a goat and all kinds of hijinks. haven't read the other books yet, but this one was enjoyable.- anything in the _xanth_ universe by piers anthony would fit this as well. he's a bit controversial these days. his writings can be pervy and misogynistic and all kinds of things like that, but... they are funny and cross lots of different realms and creatures and they have audiobook versions. they take place in a magical world that happens to look like the state of florida, and they're full of puns and various creatures and so on. each book is essentially a standalone, but there are crossover references from book to book. figured i'd mention this, even though it might not be popular.",0

5690,"so, i feel like there's two impulses intertwined here. one is the question of whether we have to be people of some sort of divine (perhaps hereditary?) provenance to be great people, and the other is whether we must do 'great' deeds to be great/good/worthwhile people.   if a lot of fantasy (and sff/spec fic more broadly) is in some way consolatory/escapist, i find it mildly unsurprising that a lot of people want to find in it stories of people doing great wondrous things and leading great wondrous lives. nevertheless it's also absolutely worth pushing back on that narrative in and of itself.   once you've dragged that out into the light of day, then you can get down to what i think you rightly identify as the more pernicious and dangerous half of the equation, which is the implicit narrative sometimes present in fantasy that in order to be that person who leads that meaningful life with those meaningful deeds (and then settles down into a meaningful life of responsible rule) one has to be of a select lineage.   i'm a little wary of touching the whole knot that is the sw sequels with a ten foot pole but maybe in thinking about examples i'd raise two. first lets go back to tolkien. tolkien is, to my mind, a bit of an interesting example in this regard. on the one hand we have the narrative of aragorn, of the dunedain, of numenor. on the other we have the elevation to protagonists of bilbo, frodo, samwise, merry, and pippin. given his 'cordial dislike' of allegory i remain a bit wary of overinvesting our reading in aragorn and ignoring the role the hobbits played (though there is still quite a bit of political implication to be mined there).  the other, since i allotted irrevocably a huge swathe of brainmatter to it, is wheel of time, which i mostly bring up because it includes in its cast almost every possible recombination of these. are the main boys heroes because they are chosen by the pattern? because they are inheritors of ancient but long humble line? because of !utterly irrelevant secret royal blood!<? are the main girls any less for not being explicitly chosen? are they better if they want humble goods versus political power?",0
5691,"you're bound to see this in western european medieval fantasy, because feudalism was a pretty big feature of that time and place. but the tendrils of feudalism run far, and remain in our consciousness still, so it's no wonder things are popular.you ask, why do we need so badly to dismiss where we come from when achieving our dreams and goals? why do we need the legitimacy in our fiction of actually being the rightful king, instead of the chosen king through effort? why is the place you started from a thing to be seen as shameful? it's not that there's a need, unless the person being addressed believes in feudalism, in which case it's pretty central.if strider were not the descendant of isildur he would never ascend the throne of gondor because gondor is a hereditary monarchy. it's a hereditary monarchy because that's the system tolkien wanted to imitate, because it, being so cemented in popular culture, fairytale and legend, was resonant for him and his audience.there is fiction, including fantasy fiction, not inspired by feudalism, but i don't think there's any mystery or issue with feudalism being commonly portrayed.",0

5820,"i can't say i agree with your interpretation of the characters in your dislikes section, some of your interpretations and comparisons (marcus, for example) seem a bit odd to me. but as with any book what seems unrealistic to some is realistic to others. same applies to geder whose inclinations to tyranny don't seem to invoke any serious guilt or contemplation in his inner dialogue.that you see this as unrealistic/unbelievable is odd to me, personally. without spoiling the end of the series for you, before his rise to power geder is a character who didn't have much in the way of meaningful human relationships. he was persistently mocked and humiliated by other nobles, and his experiences wound up making him, in turn, a fairly selfish person. he was quite sympathetic in the beginning, as a character frequently being bullied. but because of that, he grew to perceive himself persistently as the victim of everyone else's actions, rather than as having any accountability himself. there were moments early on that hinted he might develop differently, but at the end of the day he was extremely self-centred (directly relevant to how his guilt manifests itself. after his first atrocity, he certainly does appear to feel guilt and does feel haunted, but he absolves himself with the belief that he was given no choice. and like many people who are both self-centred and insecure and in positions of power, he was inclined to throw temper tantrums that had far reaching impacts on other people's lives. he does the things he does partially because he wants to send a message that he won't be mocked...and he seems to think other people do the things they do for their own survival, just to mock him. he doesn't see others as people living their own lives independent of him. it's always about geder. i've seen several real world politicians like this. here in ontario, our premier doug ford is much like this. he took his political grudges and personal feelings out on an entire city. he was pissed off that toronto repeatedly failed to vote for him as mayor, in addition to other political grievances, bringing in several policies (and reversing several others) simply to get his revenge. he's certainly ruined many ordinary people's lives, and then goes on and expects to be loved by everyone. donald trump is another politician who shares quite a few characteristics with geder. honestly you see behaviour like this quite a bit in politics, leading certain politicians to introduce or support policies that have severe impacts on normal people's lives, even leading to lose of life. although geder himself frankly seems to have somewhat more of a conscience than many politicians. think there's a lot with this character that abraham took from the real world. i similarly didn't agree with your assessment of cithrin. what you've defined as not believable as existing in the same person is honestly something i've seen fairly often in people in their 20s, especially their early 20s. intelligence does not equate emotional maturity.",0

(i'm putting this in because it's space fantasy more than it is science fiction)baudolino (umberto eco) - medieval unreliable narrator tells the story of his adoption by frederick barbarossa, and later visit to the land of prester john, to a byzantine official. it's a brilliant mix of historical fantasy with the mind-bending 'high' literature for which eco is known (name of the rose, foucalt's pendulum, etc.).now for the weird one. by all rights, senlin ascends should be a book i love - its premise sounded like it combined the best parts of some of my favourite books (discworld, the phantom tollbooth, and so on), and the first page and blurb amazed me. however, for some reason i struggle to enjoy it at all, and am only pushing through out of the desire to figure out why i'm having a hard time.

5896,"though i appreciate what you’re saying and am enjoying the discussion, i disagree. when i read asoiaf, and take them just as an incomplete set of novels, there certainly doesn’t seem to be much hope of a redemptive ending.tyrion, one of the more sympathetic characters and whose character arc is one of the big sources of the hope you mention, !does, after all murder his own father while he’s taking a shit!< and arya, another source of hope !joins a cult of murderers in order to escape a life of destitution!< . jon snow !chooses duty over love, getting his lover killed as a result; he is eventually murdered by his own underlings!<. stannis is another ‘good’ character who believes in duty and honor and doing the right thing — what becomes of him? while some characters have hope and honor, this is a liability in the world of asoiaf, which, back when the novels were fresh, was an inversion of genre tropes. also, iirc !the world is poised at the precipice of cataclysm in the most recently published book — yes, you can see the dragons coming from a long way off but dealing with the others is not portrayed as an easily surmountable obstacle!<and what about the first law, grimdark par excellence? !logan’s desire to redeem himself seems, for much of the books, to have a pretty good chance of succeeding. while we’re on the subject and in this spoiler tag, i’ll say that if i knew for sure nothing would work out in the first law books, i would definitely not have enjoyed them as much!< —  expectations can’t be frustrated if they’re not there to begin with.the larger thrust of my argument is that the broken earth trilogy meets the requirements of a reasonable definition of grimdark: !the central question in the series is whether or not murdering thousands of people directly (and millions indirectly) is a cost worth paying to remake society. there are good people in the books, but they do bad things — we’re forced as readers to decide if the ends (which are far from certain) justify those means. this alone is a bleak moral dilemma that fits the grimdark bill quite well. further, in many other fantasy novels, a similar situation plays out but it’s the villain trying to remake society through cataclysm — this inversion of bad guy vs. good guy dynamics is another defining characteristic of grimdark as i see it (see also: bayaz). i unfortunately don’t have the time here to get into the other dark and grim elements of the world building, plot, or characters of the broken earth, but i think this broad summary helps convey what i’m trying to say!<",0

6018," my issue is that there is a set up that there are strong limits on what luxin can do and how chromats can establish their mastery of those nuances over time and with practice. this makes little sense to me for two reasons: drafters have a finite amount of time they are allowed to draft, so in practice they need to get good really fast or they will not know their limits and break their halo...that’s kinda the whole purpose of the chromeria. i'm a little fuzzy on the details of what was in book 1 as opposed to later books, so this might be slight spoilers, but..  that's the whole point! it's the main conflict in the setting. we are told that drafters who break their halo ""go mad"" and need to be killed like rabid animals, but is it objectively true or is it just a power play by the leading drafter organization in order to eliminate all competition? yes, some of the folks who go over the edge do seem to be a little, or a lot, unhinged. but it is an inevitability or just a result of being persecuted, a lack of culture and guidance on how to handle the transition? is there perhaps a more significant reason than personal code of honor that causes gavin to go out of his way to personally hunt color wights?   all of these questions are examined in later books, and while i can't say that the author completely nailed all of the answers in this regard, at least the ideas make a decent amount of sense in most cases.    but by the end of the book we see a literal army of drafters raised by the color prince (somehow he gathered all of these drafters in just the one area, so apparently a large portion of the population are drafters which presents all kinds of logical problems with the chromeria being the one consolidated branch of drafting school).how does the chromeria find out about more or less any drafter? spoilers, they do have some tools, but those tools are very much imprecise and obscure, so it's very easy to imagine how a lot of people can slip through their grasp.   on top of that, chromeria is a very recent institution, iirc it's about 300 years old or so at the time of the narration? before it, every satrapy had its own tradition of drafting and its own schools for millennia. it's not easy to eradicate all of that, and not that chromeria tried too much, because its actual power is very limited and largely political in nature.  and this is without even going into the various rogue factions that haven't been introduced in book 1 yet so i won't be going into the spoiler territory.   i don’t know if my first point made much sense but basically the whole premise of drafting is i’ll defined.in general i tend to more agree than disagree, but not for the reasons you listed.    the second is wth is up with kip going from a nobody to a savant drafter with extreme raw limitless power(depending on what the plot calls for) over the course of one book.he didn't, he is very much unskilled by the end of book 1. however, his accelerated training did look more than a little implausible.  that said, the author does try to rationalize it later. it's not a terribly great rationalization.   i get that he’s “of the bloodline” and all that trope but that just went from zero to fifty out of nowhere.it's more of this.",0

6081,"she has a large vocabulary which she uses constantly to its full extent in a very exacting way. to be honest, wurts herself does a better job of explaining it; there are two ways, (really, more than that, to skin this cat) but i think there are two 'rough' catagories. you can either depict the action and let the reader supply their emotions and fill in the blanks - which is 'easier' to write and doesn't tend to step on toes or run against the grain of the readers' own experience - or you can 'define' the characters emotions and circumstances much more tightly - which forces the readership to step out of their own shoes, and even, step out of their own view point more strongly - to experience another reality different from their comfort zone. for wars of light and shadow, i chose the latter route - and though it can alienate some readers who may want to fight the grain of what the characters are experiencing on the page - it can make the read more intense for those readers who choose to step into the experience and immerse in it, wholly.​to reach that intensity of experience, you must immerse the reader into the details - and the deeper the details go, the more the immersion. this is accomplished by tying in all of the senses - sight, sound, smell, touch - with a focus that adds to the mood and also by defining, with a high degree of precision, what the character is feeling at the time. this level of immersion makes the prose very dense, and requires a tighter focus on the readerships' part to take it all in. but the magic happens as the brain slows down and the experience being described becomes more vivid.",0

(warning: the first book does have a rape / torture / mutilation scene that you can skip if you want to as anything mentioned it said again later. i mention it because it comes a little bit out of nowhere).  a conspiracy of truths by alexandra rowland - this might be up your alley as well. it's a bit more small scope than traditional epic fantasy, but it's epic in how vast the consequences are from one persons actions. i also really really loved a lot of the fresh takes on the world and characters.some other ones to check out: the sevenwater trilogy by juliet marillier exiles by melanie rawn (warning: third book has not been written in over 20 years and it might never come out but the other two are well worth the read. absolutely wonderful world with some ideas you don't see elsewhere). graceling series by kristin cashore - this one is a bit more ya (protagonists are teens) but they have to deal with world-ending stuff, and generally ya romances etc. are left out of it. there's some great magic types in here. son of avonar by carol berg  archangel by sharon shinn deverry cycle by katharine kerr rhapsody by elizabeth haydon valdemar by mercedes lackey",0

6113,"as others have mentioned the kushiel books are great, one of my favorites. i haven't yet found the time to read the third trilogy, but i reread the first trilogy (kushiel's dart, kushiel's chosen, kushiel's avatar) every few years. if you are not opposed to the sexual themes, they are a fanatastic read.what i specifically like about the books is that they combine both great political intrigue of feudal courts and globetrotting traveling adventures to far away and exotic places all mixed with a decidedly mysterious and low-fantasy vibe to the magic in the world.the second trilogy (kushiel's scion, kushiel's justice, kushiel's mercy), while still having some sexual scenes is not nearly as focussed on the whole sexual masochism nature since there is a new main character in those. the first book in the trilogy felt a bit weaker to me, but the second and third are just as good as the first  three. this trilogy is a bit more focussed on adventures to different countries, but the political intrigue, while still existant, takes a bit of a backseat. the books are however set in a very european, alternate fantasy-history, with the second trilogy playing partly in england. however england in this books is a lot more inspired by celtic influences and the classic medieval anglo-saxons. similarly there are big changes to all the countries and religions in this alternate fantasy europe, with the main characters hailing from basically france, but with a religion that is focussed on love and sexual freedom and germany for example being a lot closer to a mix of the barbarian germans of antiquity and vikings.",0

6206,"i don’t know if my first point made much sense but basically the whole premise of drafting is i’ll defined.it's not.  the color prince is assembling an army of drafters who don't care about breaking the halo.  it's basically their mission statement.the second is wth is up with kip going from a nobody to a savant drafter with extreme raw limitless powerhe kind of didn't, he went berserk and it has some real ramifications.  i guess i didn't see a lot of what he did as savantism, but i suppose this might be part of the reason why many people didn't like the first book anyway.  the green golem thing basically took a huge chunk out of his halo, i think in the text they explain that he does that 2-3 more times and he's basically fucked.  my final problem is that i just didn’t really like any of the charactersi can kind of see that.  i did not like kip in the first book either, it took me a few for me to like him more.  he does get better over time, which i think is one strength of the series; you don't necessarily need to like every character from the start.  gavin's story is pretty great though, nearly from the start...  tbp has been widely criticized for its portrayal of women (karris), which also improves in subsequent books.i think it's fine that you didn't keep reading though.  i enjoyed the series, but the last book and a half is honestly a giant trainwreck, though for entirely different reasons than your current criticisms which are more or less mostly addressed.",0

6223,"the magicians trilogy by lev grossman. it's really good fantasy; more literary than average. i love the prose as it's dense and rich and the books discusses the power of fairy tales in our childhood, how loneliness affects the way we consume literature as escapism and how mental illnesses handicap or accentuate our abilities from childhood.and yes, zero politics. :)",0

6225,"there are obviously tons of good books by women so i'm going to try to highlight ones that absolutely nail that sprawling multi-volume epic feel. these will meet most of your criteria to various degrees: kate elliott in general - crown of stars is 7 books and she's written multiple trilogies. deryni chronology by katherine kurtz - 18 books across various trilogies. realm of the elderlings by robin hobb - someone will be along to sing her praises shortly. inda by sherwood smith - 4 big books chock full of worldbuilding. kushiel's legacy by jacqueline carey - this one may not quite be the same feel (it has a more narrow focus) but it really covers a lot of ground. if the sexual elements of the setting don't put you off then i think it's worth considering in this category! an ember in the ashes by sabaa tahir - this one doesn't get a lot of attention here because it's ya and i can't recommend it if adolescent romance is a dealbreaker for you. lots of povs, magic, and non-western setting tho! the brightest shadow by sarah lin - though there's only one book out until next year it's a huge one and the series is going to be longer. it's a personal favorite of mine that i think fits your criteria well: thick tomes, eastern-inspired magic very present, epic scope, non-western setting. if you're interested in a twisted subversion of heroic archetypes check it out!",0

6239,"there are so many. kate elliott's crown of stars is a 7 book epic fantasy written around the same time as asoiaf and wot, and in my opinion is of the same quality. only problem is it has heavy european influences.robin hobb's realm of the elderlings is 16 books of epic fantasy. the magic is low key but very present.naomi novik's temeraire series is a long series and is the napoleonic wars with dragons as a kind of air force for both sides. the fun part is that later books explore south america, australia, and africa, so it isn't only european.martha wells has the books of the raksura, which is a long series set in a world with no humans and tons of history and unique fantasy races.then there is the brightest shadow by sarah lin. it is a new self published first book in an epic fantasy series, but it's something like 1200 pages by itself.i'm sure there's more, but those are the ones from the top of my head",0

6332,"this is more about setting than premise, but i picked up titus groan based solely on a description of gormenghast castle in the dictionary of imaginary places by alberto manuel and gianni guadalupi. the book describes the castle itself, the landscape it stands in, and gives some idea of the people there and how they live, alluding to characters and events of the story in a detached style that makes it unclear how much is being given away. it's never stated what the book is about or which character(s) the reader follows. the editors did a great job of describing this place and its people in their own way while still taking their cues from the source material in terms of language:the castle is so vast that members of the household may not see each other for weeks. the main building consists of several large wings, although the additions and alterations made over the centuries make it almost impossible to trace the ground plan. the result is a bizarre collection of buildings; some, like the pavilions, observatories and galleries, have an obvious use; the purpose of others remains obscure. one curious structure, for instance, is an area entirely packed with pillars that are set so close together that is impossible for a normal man to force his way through them. another has a stone carving of a huge lion holding the limp corpse of a man in its jaws; the corpse bears the inscription ""he was an enemy of groan.""many of these experiments in architecture are now in a semi-ruinous state, but the most sinister of all is still the tower of flints, in the east wing. the tallest of the many towers of gormenghast, it is a time-eaten edifice covered with black ivy and inhabited by death-owls which rises up from the fields of masonry like a mutilated finger pointing blasphemously at heaven. it is associated with the macabre end of lord sepulchrave, the 76th earl of groan. after a long period of depression, sepulchrave became convinced that he was a death-owl and began to eat rats which he caught in the subterranean kitchens of the castle. he finally entered the tower of flints itself, taking the present of a corpse with him to give to the resident owls, and was torn to pieces by the savage birds.no idea what the book was actually about, or what the overall tone might be like based on this description - never mind the fantastic but alarming prose the author uses, oh my - i still couldn't resist picking this book up, just based on this. i've always had a weakness for labyrinthine and lonely places, mazes full of mute and watchful ghosts. i was not disappointed.",0

6343,"well, thanks for the lesson, but as a historian i can tell you this is wrong and something put out by youtube videos and the likes with little rigour and scarce actual knowledge on the matter. reality is, a peasant is a peasant and must dedicate much of his/her life to farming. very few were ever known to be good warriors and the warrior class actually emerged out of need precisely because people could not devote a life to farming and be good warriors. warrior traditions are not a simple thing in any culture. but all this, and your wonderful and thoughtful explanation is unnecessary. (though i appreciate it dearly). mat does not beat these guys for any of those reasons but mainly because he is an mc and it seemed cool that he would beat two knights after being a wuss for 2 books. that may be cool for some people, like you. but to me, it felt childish and something i would see in an anime show. now, for those who are hating on me, i actually liked the wot and i have a special place in my heart for robert jordan. it's just that this specific moment seems so immature and ridiculous to me, precisely because it undermines the fact that knights are not just given a sword, plate armour and a horse. they start at 7 and very few become squires. out of those very few become knights at 21 at best... so. i don't know. peasants with polearms are hardly what kept the armies at tours at bay. and yes, the romanticisation of these vents did happen, but there's little to no proof of this. and a few examples (because there are), do not demonstrate that peasants with sticks were better than armed men with steel.cheers!",0

6418,"syl is one of sanderson's whimsical characters that doesn't sit right with me. i call out my own religion to at least signal my personal bias in this regard. any storyline that involves prophecies, portents, and visions fall flat for me. dalinar's visions in the high storms make no illusion that they are true. there is no risk that what dalinar saw is false. if there was an actual risk they were true and dalinar truly mad, i would find them interesting. but, they aren't. the ending infuriates me because of the message it sends. if it included a lot of other information, i would be fine. but, the narration specifically calls out sazed specifically draws from religious sources and nothing else. elevates the religious sources above all other sources by calling specific attention to them in the narration. there is a way to gain mistborn magic artificially, but it is completely unavailable and unknown to most of the population so it might as well not exist in the context of the narrative because...it never comes into play. it might come into play in the third trilogy, but as it stands, it doesn't.even if it was coopted by the religion, in the context of the story there is no counter to it. the implicit message it sends is clear to me. 3x arranged marriages that end in ""true love""1. wax/steris2. !adolin and shallan!<3. !siri and susebron the god king in warbreaker!<",0

6495,"these are of course your opinions, everybody takes away something different, but i wanted to respond to a few of these:1. i can’t speak for all the instances you’re thinking of, as i haven’t read the entire cosmere just yet (just sa, mistborn, and the first wax & wayne book), but i thought that at least in the case of !adolin and shallan!< it was pretty charming. a lot of romances in sanderson’s stories feel very refreshing actually. this is probably at least partly because i’m not a fan of a lot of the romance conflicts (and just romance plots period frankly) i read in other fantasy. i love the scene when !shallan finds out about jasnah’s tentative plans!<. an unorthodox but positive start and they also just happen to enjoy each other’s company. (also !dalinar’s arc!< is like reverse this)2. i think the point was that he was completely alone, the lowest he could possibly be inside and out. the !spren is basically a part of him, but he stopped because she expended a huge amount of energy in an innocent attempt to help, however misguided. and also, this was a situation where death may very well have been preferable (and was for many).!<3. i honestly can’t tell you how much i disagree! as a total agnostic, funnily enough, the end of hero of ages was and still is one of my favorite endings ever. !all of sazed’s peers consider him an eccentric, and his chosen subject is basically ignored by every person he tries to explain it to, it’s not seen as a worthy subject. but the reason it’s perfect for when he gains the powers of the shards is because of the breadth of his knowledge, not the depth. !<religion is the way many people and peoples interpret the world around them, and each culture values different things. !another keeper that focused on biology might have been able to focus on all the minutia of life but might not have been able to navigate the night sky! his true strength is that he holds all the qualities of nature and especially humanity in equal value. !<the reason i love this ending is because it’s the simultaneous culmination and validation of his life. !the mistborn trilogy is as much about sazed’s loss of faith as it is about vin.!<4. this really is an opinion-based thing more than anything else. i personally enjoy how his characters have both powers and responsibility thrust upon them whether they like it or not. a huge amount of the conflict is on how they struggle with the things they can’t change.sorry for the wall of text, i’m high and a fanboy.",0

6598," the first is that grimdark describes a story where the storyline is bleak and there's no hope this is the definition that actual authors of grimdark use.   this is the ""real"" definition, as far as that can be claimed.  joe abercrombie, for example, (""lord grimdark"" himself)  has often talked about how for him the essence of the genre is nihilism.  he's said ""life is basically shit"" in more than once interview.   this is a running theme in his books.  people are shit, nothing will ever get better because they'll always fuck it up   etc etc,  cynicism, nihilism. that's what distinguishes the genre from others, that embrace of nihilism.  the second describes it as a story that features a lot of violence this second one useless because it also basically describes every single fantasy story.     ""lots of violence""  doesn't distinguish it from anything that came before. so, in short, use the definition that actually distinguishes it.   cynicism, nihilism, no hope = grimdarklots of violence  =  could be any genre.",0

6857,"i thought the trailer wasn't very good at all. it all looked so... market researched generic blah. the costumes, the aesthetic. it was just all so... safe. it was generic military scifi #23, rather than dune. to me.then i found out they were gender bending one of the characters. didn't make sense. apparently there weren't enough women in the story. if they wanted more women, perhaps they should've chosen to adapt any of the myriad and wonderful books that are written with women or by women or both at the same time rather than just arbitrarily changing characters. i already got burned by that recently in a musical i attended so i'm soured on the whole thing. finally, the soundtrack. i love pink floyd but again that distorted female vocal remix that is every fucking trailer nowadays? ehh.. not feeling curious. overall it looks like it has nothing interesting from the visual perspective, which is a shame since dune offers a lot of space for experimentation. i miss the old late 80s and 90s movies that were not afraid to have some interesting costuming. i mean just look at the fremen in the trailer. those people live in the still suits, yet we aren't shown any personalization? but wait, maybe they're doing something clever and subversive. maybe the visuals are western generic on purpose so that they can sneak in some of the book choice of words like jihad? maybe, none of us seen the movie after all yet, but the trailer is all about that ""crusade"" safety. we just cant have people starting conversations.honestly i probably wouldn't mind the trailer at all, but i love the book so it just makes me critical. everyone wants to see a well loved worked adapted well or at least in a memorable way.",0

""isak is a white-eye, feared and despised in equal measure. trapped in a life of poverty, hated and abused by his father, isak dreams of escape, but when his chance comes, it isn't to a place in the army as he'd expected. instead, the gods have marked him out as heir-elect to the brooding lord bahl, the lord of the fahlan.lord bahl is also a white-eye, a genetic rarity that produces men stronger, more savage and more charismatic than their normal counterparts. their magnetic charm and brute strength both inspires and oppresses others.now is the time for revenge, and the forging of empires. with mounting envy and malice the men who would themselves be kings watch isak, chosen by gods as flawed as the humans who serve them, as he is shaped and moulded to fulfil the prophecies that are encircling him like scavenger birds. the various factions jostle for the upper hand, and that means violence, but the gods have been silent too long and that violence is about to spill over and paint the world the colour of spilled blood and guts and pain and anguish.""",0

6987,"while i think this is a very well thought out post and argument, i do think that the arguments against your concerns here are at least as good as yours. the difficulty is the heart of a good philosophical debate, which is part of what makes sandersons work really impressive! the lord ruler creating the skaa to be genetically inferior to the nobles in order to have a working class engages a really interesting question about labor supply and demand. tlr didn't do it just because he wanted some slaves to make the nobles lives easier. he did it because the demand for more farmers was really high in this broken new ashworld he'd created. if they didn't have a significant portion of the population farming, they wouldn't produce enough to survive. this doesn't mean by any stretch that what he did was good, but the real debate is about what he could have done instead that would have saved the same or more lives. there's no easy answer to this, which negates the issue of sanderson accidentally supporting enslaving an inferior race/species/whatever, imo.one of my favorite scenes is where sanderson pushes back against this idea you're concerned he unintentionally promotes: sah slammed the hatchet down into the wood, sending a chip fluttering into the air. “and that’s why we should be free now? because we’re acting like you? we deserved slavery before, when we were different? it’s all right to dominate us when we won’t fight back, but now it’s not, because we can _talk_?” “well, i mean—” “that’s why i’m angry! thank you for what you’re showing us, but don’t expect me to be happy that i need you for it. this just reinforces the belief within you, maybe even within myself, that your people should be the ones who decide upon our freedom in the first place.”",0

6990,"just to be clear, you're talking about whatever the organisation teia gets involved with in lightbringer and the ghostbloods and shallan in the stormlight archive?the reason i ask is because i don't see either as cult in our real-world sense of the word. neither of these organizations has a primary focus on a religious ideal. they're instead secret organizations that specialise in intelligence gathering and assassination for whatever goal with some mystical trappings (which i attribute to both groups belonging to fantasy settings).if you see these groups not as religious/mystical cults but as spy organizations of sorts, they make a lot more sense. if you want to join such an organization, a more extreme act is needed to convince the leaders you're dedicated to joining them. no cult would do this; they prefer the slow corruption you describe but if these are not cults, why would they rely on the same rules? these groups operate in secrecy and don't particularly care to spread their ideals. they'll recruit people but not as a believers primarily but as agents instead.",0

6997,"i grew up on it, so i am.kind of biased.  while it takes a lot of liberties with the details, it really does a great job with the internal monologue driven narrative.  in many ways it is superior to the later, more sci-fi driven miniseries, especially some of the later recuts.  it is going to be interesting what approach the new dune movie will take.  if they just go full-on, hero driven, sci-fi, space opera spectacle, they are going to leave out a lot of the what makes dune better than star wars.",0

7001,"i could be wrong, but i thought the only biological difference between skaa and nobles is that nobles could use allomancy. the rest is suggested to be nutritional and environmental iirc, according to some stuff elend says. it's just that the nobles have a narrative of the skaa being inferior; when it comes to intelligence there is no biological difference.",0
7002,"the plantations for one, and some of the 'dressings' of the relationship between noble and skaa are very reminiscent of that time. as for your second question. short answer, no, not really. one cannot create a work in a vacuum. any author should take cultural context into account when releasing a book and i know for a fact that sanderson is very aware of this. he's spoken at length about it.however, as i mentioned in a reply above, the point of my post wasn't intended to drill down on the specific allegorical implications anyway. it was more of a general point about the portrayal of race and slavery that happened to be amplified by the fact that it was written by a white american.any difficult topic in fiction should be approached with care and justifying slavery with genetically engineering the race to be slaves would be a bad look regardless of who the author was. again, i believe sanderson's intent was to make a progressive commentary but this commentary got lost and then undermined later in the series.",0
7003,"i think everyone has a right to put forward an analysis, but that doesn’t mean they’ll all be equally valid. i think there are some things that can legitimately be left up to interpretation, while others just come from a flawed reading of the text and its context, which the author should indeed be able to set right.for example, a lot of right-wing readers might tell you that the message of 1984 and animal farm is that socialism is bad and capitalism is good. does that interpretation have equal value with orwell saying they’re about capitalism, fascism, and stalinism all being authoritarian ideologies and that his intent was to promote democratic socialism? given that you can see the themes directly grow out of orwell’s experiences fighting in the spanish civil war (for anarchist/democratic socialism and against fascism, capitalism, and stalinism), the text of 1984 says that capitalism also contained the seeds of totalitarianism, and the ending of animal farm is “in the end, stalinism was just as bad as what came before and not as good as the period after the revolution but before the authoritarian takeover” not “what came before was so much better,” then i’d say that the right-wing interpretation is just fundamentally less accurate and less valuable than orwell’s own. but it is unfortunately very common.i’d say there can be surface-level interpretations of a work and deeper interpretations. the latter don’t always have to come from the author themself, but often an author can provide context or state their intent in such a way that recontextualizes your reading and makes you get the deeper meaning. if someone reads the forever war by joe haldeman with no other context and comes out thinking “oh, he wrote this because he wanted to warn us about the social implications of interstellar travel and war,” but then the author informs them that while yes, that was part of it and on the surface, it was primarily an allegory for the alienation felt by returning vietnam war veterans, the proper response should be “oh, that makes so much sense, i now see this much deeper and richer meaning,” not “nuh-uh, my interpretation is just as valid as yours.”there are certainly times when an author can’t let go of their work and keeps retconning things, or says they had an intent that even knowing it really isn’t visible in the text, or claims that a story really was not influenced by some part of their cultural context when someone outside that context can see the unconscious impact that it must have had. all of those are valid ways of analyzing a text counter to the author’s own analysis. but to totalize that as “the author’s interpretation is no more valid than the reader’s” at all times is a mistake, i think. the author doesn’t have a monopoly on truth, but more often than not, they will have a better handle on their intent and the themes of the work than the average reader. obviously everyone is allowed to have an opinion, we don’t (yet) live in a mind control society. but sometimes the rest of us are allowed to say “that’s a really shallow interpretation, maybe you should listen to the author...”",0

7081,blacks were not enslaved based on being lesser races. that was a later justification that showed up occasionally. but it's still not an allegory. that's three point there. allegory requires far not connection and you can't fault it for being badly allegorical when it isn't allegorical.and my second paragraph stands. it's clearly declared that slavery and racism is bad even with the biological difference. in the real world there are biological differences between races (albeit too miniscule to matter in any way i've seen beyond certain health care situations). so even if we found some insane actual biological difference that was 100% proven these books would argue you still couldn't enslaved people.,0

7083,"i grew up watching the 84 dune and i loved it. it was so much darker and weirder than star wars, flash gordon and all of the other “space opera” sci-fi movies i loved in the 80s. the cast was outrageously good. of course i prefer the much longer version than the messy two hour cut they used to show on tv. the cool networks would split the long version into 2 parts and show them across two nights in the summer. i’ll never forget paul atreides riding the sandworm accompanied by a thunderstorm and a soundtrack by toto, bringing down destruction on the harkonnens. it was as wagnerian as 80s sci-fi ever got. so damn cool.it’s funny how stuff imprints on you from an early age. years later when i read the book for the first time - masterpiece that it is - i couldn’t help but picture the lynch aesthetics on every page, and couldn’t divorce the characters in my mind’s eye from the actors that portrayed them in the film. sting in particular was very inspired casting.the villenueve film looks amazing and the man has made some of the best films this century with no duds on his resume. i’m on board 100 percent. that being said the trailers do strike me as more of a remake of the 84 dune and less a totally new adaptation of the book. which i would be fine with!",0

(letter 109, 1947)""i dislike allegory – the conscious and intentional allegory – yet any attempt to explain the purport of myth or fairytale must use allegorical language. (and, of course, the more 'life' a story has the more readily will it be susceptible of allegorical interpretations: while the better a deliberate allegory is made the more nearly will it be acceptable just as a story.)"" (letter 131, 1951)about tom bombadil ""i do not mean him to be an allegory – or i should not have given him so particular, individual, and ridiculous a name – but 'allegory' is the only mode of exhibiting certain functions: he is then an 'allegory', or an exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science:"" (letter 153, 1954)""what appreciative readers have got out of the work or seen in it has seemed fair enough, even when i do not agree with it. always excepting, of course, any 'interpretations' in the mode of simple allegory: that is, the particular and topical. in a larger sense, it is i suppose impossible to write any 'story' that is not allegorical in proportion as it 'comes to life'; since each of us is an allegory, embodying in a particular tale and clothed in the garments of time and place, universal truth and everlasting life. anyway most people that have enjoyed the lord of the rings have been affected primarily by it as an exciting story; and that is how it was written. though one does not, of course, escape from the question 'what is it about?' by that back door. that would be like answering an aesthetic question by talking of a point of technique. i suppose that if one makes a good choice in what is 'good narrative' (or 'good theatre') at a given point, it will also be found to be the case that the event described will be the most 'significant'."" (letter 163, 1955)""thank you for your letter. i hope that you have enjoyed the lord of the rings? enjoyed is the key-word. for it was written to amuse (in the highest sense): to be readable. there is no 'allegory', moral, political, or contemporary in the work at all.it is a 'fairy-story', but one written – according to the belief i once expressed in an extended essay 'on fairy-stories' that they are the proper audience – for adults. because i think that fairy story has its own mode of reflecting 'truth', different from allegory, or (sustained) satire, or 'realism', and in some ways more powerful. but first of all it must succeed just as a tale, excite, please, and even on occasion move, and within its own imagined world be accorded (literary) belief. to succeed in that was my primary object.but, of course, if one sets out to address 'adults' (mentally adult people anyway), they will not be pleased, excited, or moved unless the whole, or the incidents, seem to be about something worth considering, more e.g. than mere danger and escape: there must be some relevance to the 'human situation' (of all periods). so something of the teller's own reflections and 'values' will inevitably get worked in. this is not the same as allegory. we all, in groups or as individuals, exemplify general principles; but we do not represent them. the hobbits are no more an 'allegory' than are (say) the pygmies of the african forest. gollum is to me just a 'character' – an imagined person – who granted the situation acted so and so under opposing strains, as it appears to he probable that he would (there is always an incalculable element in any individual real or imagined: otherwise he/she would not be an individual but a 'type'.) (letter 181, 1956)""of course my story is not an allegory of atomic power, but of power (exerted for domination). nuclear physics can be used for that purpose. but they need not be. they need not be used at all. if there is any contemporary reference in my story at all it is to what seems to me the most widespread assumption of our time: that if a thing can be done, it must be done."" (letter 196, 1956)""there is no 'symbolism' or conscious allegory in my story. allegory of the sort 'five wizards = five senses' is wholly foreign to my way of thinking. there were five wizards and that is just a unique part of history. to ask if the orcs 'are' communists is to me as sensible as asking if communists are orcs.that there is no allegory does not, of course, say there is no applicability. there always is. and since i have not made the struggle wholly unequivocal: sloth and stupidity among hobbits, pride and illegible among elves, grudge and greed in dwarf-hearts, and folly and wickedness among the 'kings of men', and treachery and power-lust even among the 'wizards', there is i suppose applicability in my story to present times. but i should say, if asked, the tale is not really about power and dominion: that only sets the wheels going; it is about death and the desire for deathlessness. which is hardly more than to say it is a tale written by a man!"" (letter 203, 1957)""i have no didactic purpose, and no allegorical intent. (i do not like allegory (properly so called: most readers appear to confuse it with significance or applicability) but that is a matter too long to deal with here.) but long narratives cannot be made out of nothing; and one cannot rearrange the primary matter in secondary patterns without indicating feelings and opinions about one's material.""

(if anything, it would be more linked to wars as a general concept rather than just ww1 or ww2)tl;dr: tolkien doesn't merely say ""i did not intent to write a ww1 allegory and therefore it is everything but that, and anybody making the link is wrong""; he said ""you're free to see what you want in the book, but it wasn't my intent so you'd be wrong in taking this allegory as a fact if you want to analyse what lotr meant to me as an author when i wrote it"".death of the author does allow you to interpret the story however you want (to which tolkien kinda agrees with, as long as it stays your headcanon only), but you can't use it to say ""the author meant that and nothing else when he wrote it, no doubt permitted"" - that's just a straight-up lie!",0

'right-ish'). personally, i prefer my failures to be ambitious rather than pedestrian - the lynch adaptation is pure insanity, but you can't fault its ambition. i'm hoping that villenueve, given his prior films, will fall more into that camp. but excited to find out!",0

(which is fair--i often undervalue greatness-of-plot, for example, i think). it is gorgeous and sad and hilarious; suffused with magic without any complicated rube-goldberg worldbulding; its voice, piranesi's voice, is miraculous—engaging and tender and strange; and it manages profundity with the lightest touch.",0

7367,"drow society was invented by gary gargax.  he took elven society that was not well fleshed out, and inverted it.  i think that the early game novels like the dragonlance chronicles and the icewind dale trilogy can't be separated from their deep ties to the game.   d&d started very simple and slowly started to officially support more gray.",0
7368,i did not like it. i did very much like the syfy miniseries though.,0
7369,"i think you’ll be pleased to know that in her publishing deal with bloomsbury, clarke signed on to write two books. however i don’t think it will be a sequel given the ending of piranesi. the other big question is if clarke wrote piranesi and the other book in the years between js&mn and piranesi, or if she started writing the next book after she finished piranesi. so it could either be a (relatively) short wait or another long one.",0
7370,"i kind of don't agree with these call outs. i don't feel we are ever supposed to be sympathetic with the lord ruler. aside from that single sazed quote we are constantly told he had good intentions but was still a garbage tyrant all the way through book 3.as for lopen, i disagree more. the stormlight archives are full of characters who are hero's despite various mental disabilities. in lopens case, it isn't that he can't be a hero. it is that he can't fight as well with one arm. that's just the simple truth of the matter, in my opinion. you could try as hard as you want to justify him being a badass one armed fighter, but at the end of the day you can't really make him more skilled than those who have had signifcamtlyyyyyyyy longer to train and aren't faced with his physical disability.",0
7372,"i think kate elliot’s crossroads reads like slice-of-life for the main part, and it definitely has dark undertones,  and trigger content both implicitly and explicitly.it is a slow-build story over three books, which has themes related to war, religion, slavery and immigration to varying degrees.   the story is told from different povs but everyone is involved in their own day to day shit, and the stakes, even when they are high, are mostly personal i have only read the first two books, there’s a potential scale large conflict looming and tension is building   it could become more epic, but the story is very character driven.as i’m relatively new to fantasy, i had my doubts whether the series counts as slice of life so i looked up the r/fantasy ‘s bingo card description (below) and i think it qualifies.“slice of life / small scale fantasy –  the term ""slice of life"" refers to a storytelling technique that presents a seemingly arbitrary sample of a character's life, which often lacks a coherent plot, conflict, or ending. the story may have little plot progress and often has no exposition, conflict, or dénouement.”if anyone is familiar with the series, i’d appreciate another take.",0
7373,it’s a bad dune movie and a pretty interesting david lynch movie.,0
7374,i read this book some time ago but it just felt soo slow. i think it started to put up some speed towards the end. i really can't remember much of what happened in the book. i think i liked the story but it must not have been enough for me to pick up the second part.  i think maybe a diffrent book was released that made my attention turn away,0

7376,"his own style.  like others have said, his writing is more to the point and concise, which seems to have worked for most, but i wasn't much of a fan.the differences were especially jarring in the first book sanderson took over.  most of the characters felt completely different and i seriously contemplated dropping the series.  i remember being 100 or so pages into it and thinking ""holy crap, he ruined it"".  i was pretty bummed out.fortunately, he seems to find his groove in the next two books, but those last three books keep me from a re-read whenever i get an itch for some randland.",0
7377,lots of historically that battle shows what happens when you use a staff/spear against a sword or even multiple swords. the reach outdoes the sword in most cases even from trained swordsmen. the fight was fairly accurate. which is why i wondered why you thought it was ridiculous.,0
7378,"i think i read the first trilogy when i was around 13 and i liked the books well enough, but thought they were a tad depressing. i wanted a story about adventure, and overcoming challenges and a badass protagonist. this series is definitely not that.  then i ended up rereading the books in my early twenties and i appreciated them much more. actually, it was interesting how differently i perceived certain moments and characters.   i definitely wouldn't classify the books as ya. the story is told as a sort of autobiography, the protagonist recounting his childhood. and you have a very realistic depiction of how a child and later a teenager would behave, with all of the mistakes and dumb choices one would make and the failure to grasp certain consequences or reasoning.   then there's the part that you as a reader can see, but that is never acknowledged by the protagonist (even his 30 year old self), as he himself still doesn't understand it - all the child abuse he was put through, all of his own mental problems stemming from said childhood and so on... all in all, it's a pretty heavy story with a lot of subtlety, told through a very limited perspective, making certain things easy to miss.",0
7379,"well this really depends on what encapsulates fantasy for you ! is it magic (wands, potions, maybe even herbs if you stretch the imagination far enough) or battles (swords, helmets, full body armour and so forth) or more something whimsical (in which case i'd look towards what themes are apparent in middle grade fantasy since ""whimsy"" is hardly a concept with easy visuals attached to it) and also whether you like fantasy based on medieval european cultures, or african fantasy or asian inspired fantasy or even futuristic scifi-fantasy! sounds like a fun idea though!",0
7380,"channel 4 used to greenlight some awesome, experimental shows.also most of the best british comedies of the past 20 years.",0
7381,kings of the wyld,0
7382,i agree completely. this show was terrible. so inconsistent and relied on a couple of hooks and some quality acting to tell a really unsatisfying and frankly disgusting story. i normally love this kind of shit but it just didn’t go anywhere or say anything. the genuinely disgusting violence throughout this whole show for absolutely no payoff really pissed me off. baby’s getting shot etc. horrifying stuff in a really bleak time. also at the end of the season when it turns out the guy writing the comic was evil? what a stupid end to the main mystery of the show. i hated it. don’t waste your time. plus all the little arrogant self referential easter eggs gillian flynn added in. i’m angry at myself that i finished watching it. i’ve never hated a show this much before lol,0
7383,"depends how they're used.chapter titles that are just pov name and location can be really helpful in multi-pov books.and some authors manage expectations really well -- the title can ""spoil"" part of what's going to happen in a way that leads reader expectations astray in a fun way.a sort of cheap trick is using them to point to the ""zinger"" line of the chapter -- so that the reader will recognize when the author's favorite line shows up because it echoes the title. but even that can be effective, when used well.chapter headings can get very spoilerific in the old-style (see: dickens) version where you get things like: chapter 3 relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecurebut then, dickens was a pretty good storyteller, and he seems to have made it work. :)",0

7386,"the fact that you automatically consider both orogones a x-men dangerous just because they can do things you can't is quite worrying. it's the basic argument that lead to many atrocities through out history. ""these people are not like us. they're other and dangerous."" the whole reason people like magneto radicalise or alabaster rips open the planet is not because they are inherently dangerous or evil. it is because people with viewpoints like yours act to imprison or kill them and they then feel they have no choice but to react violently.",0
7387,lol yes america bad upvote to right pls,0
7388,"i think you drastically underestimate the rhetorical power of compelling narrative. also the possibility of reasonable people believing in ridiculous things if they’re presented in the right way. after all, some things that initially sound ridiculous end up being true!",0
7389,"yeah, i loved it. i'm a dune fan and a david lynch fan. it's a flawed masterpiece. lynch originally came up with a film that ran for about 6 hours but the producer, dino di lorentis, insisted it by cut down to less than half of that.",0

7391,"the one that comes to mind for me is the painting quest from elder scrolls oblivion. iirc, you are sent to find an elf who has gone missing, and while investigating his house you find a magical painting, which you get sucked into. the game applies a heavy paint shader to everything, and you fight painted versions of animals (spiders?). then you have to find the elf, and realize he crafted the world to get away from everyone. i like that it was beautiful and meta, since you were playing a game to get away from the world. at least that's what i remember. i haven't played that game in ages. there are similar painted worlds in the dark souls games as well, which are beautiful levels separated from the rest of the interconnected world, but without the heavy shader which makes oblivion's so memorable.",0

7397,"the twenty palaces series by harry connolly.spectacular trilogy. really unique. flawed mc (violent felon trying to turn his life around) recruited to fight mind-blowing reality-altering monsters as part of a secret society of morally-questionable wizards. everything about the monsters and magic is incredibly creative and interesting.but they didn't sell well enough. so there were only three books written, and the author was forced to move on to other projects.",0
7398,"so it's a web serial, but worm by wildbow has a very gritty feel.  my understanding is that at points he rolled dice to see who survives the encounters, including for the main characters.  and no one gets through unscathed, even the lucky characters. it involves a parallel reality where super powers start manifesting.  it starts with the pov of a billie teenager who can control insects.  while seeking to prove herself as a hero she 'infiltrates' a gang of villains.  it's a fantastic read, one of the best climaxes i have read in a  story.  its not a short story either so loots of meat to get through.  he has another serial called pact that can be exhausting to read through because it's one tragedy after another.  that 100% has what you are looking for, no one gets through unscathed, even i'm victory.  worm is his better work, but pact is still really good.",0

7400,"the secret commonwealth is certainly an interesting book.  some were not fans since there is no resolution, but it was meant as a two book arc.  the book is ripe with political and religious strife.  as if the relationship between lyra and pan.  you get to see the ramifications of lyra’s experiences and how she’s more woke compared to the population.",0
7401,"it has a place, i think it brings enough of its own creativity and weirdness to have a place in pop culture... though you can defiantly hear the whispers of the studio 'make it like star wars' that david lynch was probably sick of by the end.",0
7402,"i haven’t been able to get into the book/series but i really enjoy the 84 movie. when i first saw it as a kid it was different from star wars and star trek and i kept rewatching it as i got older, it’s not a masterpiece but the strangeness and world building always pull me in.",0

7418,"damn, those are a lot of books",0
7419,"kingdom come deliverance puts you through a  lot of interesting side quests. side quest spoilers ahead! there's one where the village priest, father godwin,tells you that three women in the village have come under suspicion of witchcraft and he needs you to follow them and see if there's any truth to the rumors and try to keep them safe. after following them for some time and learning of their intentions !(they want to drive the cumans, who killed some of their loved ones) !<they foolishly try to perform a ritual using a hallucinogenic plant and when you intervene you get accidentally dosed and start having insane hallucinations as well. then a group of angry woodcutters attacks the women for witchcraft. you have to choose whether to kill the woodcutters to save the three women or let the women be killed before you pass out. it's an extremely interesting quest, though i think it has some very problematic elements to it which are played for laughs which unfortunately ruined it for me. still, it is a unique quest that explored medieval fears around witches and witchcraft but also demonstrated that the three alleged ""witches"" in action were not acting out of evil or malice but rather out of immense grief and fear of the invading rebels in their homeland.",0
7420," even if the lord ruler was portrayed as evil throughout (which he isn’t,  and that makes it so much worse) by writing an allegory for slavery and  then retconning the idea that there was a biological disparity all  along, the work essentially implies there could be a biological  disparity between the real world counterparts of the allegory. yeah,  super not great. actually, tremendously fucked up the more you think  about it. that part seems very far fetched to me. i agree that it isn't helpful for the theme in the first book, but that conclusion is not valid. lopens arm regrowth is something that has been heavily discussed and it seems sanderson took the criticism he received for it to heart, since there are no implications that rysn's paraplegia is going away by magic.",0
7421,"none of this had occurred to me, but having it laid out like this does make it clear. definitely something i'll carry with me into rereads. i think you're absolutely right about it being unintentional, and it makes sense that it likely came about through plot adjustments to make future concepts work. as someone who wants to be a writer, this feels like a valuable thing to keep in mind when i craft stories. thanks for the thoughtful analysis.",0

7428,the work of j.j grandville.,0
7429,it depends on the title names. some authors pull it off that it does not spoil anything. it is vague and only makes sense when the reader has already read the chapter. chapter titles also help the reader remember what happened if they are scanning for something or mark some moments in the book. i don't know about chapters titles at the end though. i haven't seen it done before but i would have to try it to have an opinion.,0

7478,"you’re right that that is what my words sounded like, so i apologize for that, but it wasn’t my intention. what i meant was that to the vast majority of readers who have taken the time to interpret and discuss his work, it seems to clearly be a meditation on the world wars and post war europe. but i certainly could have worded that better, you are right.",0

7493,currently going through foundryside by bennett. it’s a blast.,0
7494,"i think that’s an over-restrictive definition. generally, i agree with you that genre is marketing noise but that’s not all it is. genre terms are useful for description and organization, helping a reader understand how to “shelve” a book mentally/digitally/physically. right?what you’re saying is that a book is only grimdark if it is marketed as grimdark? or only grimdark if an author says it’s grimdark? the term loses a lot of its usefulness if that’s the case.  it seems to me that if asoiaf, !where the good guys get killed!< , where the plot is reliably bleak, and where the central theme is being a good person won’t save you,  isn’t grimdark, then grimdark is a sort of spoiler tag where a reader will know for certain that no part of the plot is allowed to end in resolution.seems to me like this would remove a degree of tension and excitement from reading these kinds of books. i think one can reasonably shelve the broken earth trilogy with other grimdark titles as it shares many of that subgenre’s hallmarks in terms of plot, theme, characters, and setting. it is also fantasy that is objectively grim and dark; !saying anything about its hopefulness is in many ways a spoiler!< . let genre serve the reader and not the publisher!",0

7499,“half-wit dirt eaters” is an interesting take from someone with terrible grammar who can’t spell riddance.,0
7500,"wow this is a really bad take. tolkien probably didn’t intentionally make his story a meditation on the world wars, but he fought in the first one, and the themes of lord of the rings are very reflective of someone fought in terrible and destructive wars themselves. that’s not people making up their own shit, that’s people noticing parallels and drawing connections, whether or not the author accepts those or not.and if everyone who ever had their own interpretation of a work sat down and wrote their own books, the world would have too many books and not enough people working in other industries. your take here is basically maximum intellectual elitism, preserving the privilege of interpretation for only a handful of people and denying everyone else who are more than smart enough to interpret works for themselves the right to do so. some people aren’t too uncreative to make their own works, they’re too poor, or too busy, or too uneducated (as in illiterate, but illiterate people can still make up stories). i’d recommend you get off your high horse and recognize that authors are more privileged, not more creative, than everyone else.",0

7506,it's not a valid engagement because they are making up their own shit. if tolkien said his work wasn't a medditation on wwii that just means thousands upon thousands of people were to lazy to create one of their own.,0

7514,"i think there’s something here about the desire for a reader stand-in protagonist in fantasy. they have to be free from any context or attachments so they can go and have consequence-free adventures and so they’re new to any given situation or location, allowing the author to explain things to a fresh pair of eyes. any particulars beyond broad personality traits could hinder that self-insert aspect, even if it’s worthwhile and interesting familial or relationship contexts.i think this dovetails with the young protagonist thing in school or school-like narratives. everything’s new, all the relationships are being formed before the protagonist’s eyes, the stage is set for the protagonist to do stuff and become the centre of attention.there might be something central to the idea of the bourgeois novel about having a very individualist, atomised protagonist actively doing things but it’s very noticeable in fantasy.",0

7518,"got had its issues elsewhere and fundamentally, d&d didn't understand the source material. they knew they only wanted to do 8 seasons early enough that they could have started to wrap things up earlier but that wouldn't have fixed their inability to understand that actions need consequences and those consequences have to apply to the wider population. that's why asoiaf was so popular because martin understood that and applied it in his universe. d&d ignored that because it didn't line up with the story they wrote. also the ending they were given by martin re kings landing could make sense in the books given !faegon existing and being backed by varys!<. i do agree that martin is struggling because he needs to start wrapping up plot points and as a gardener author, he is struggling to work out how that needs to happen.sanderson on the flip side clearly understood what made wot work and even if some people didn't like the execution, it still fundamentally felt like wot. there are a lot of parallels you can make between martin and jordan since they both have popular epic fantasy series that were originally meant to be trilogies and have since gotten stretched out significantly",0
7519,"so...you don’t consider lord of the rings a meditation on the world wars and post-war europe, just because tolkien said it wasn’t? because it clearly was. this is death of the author in literary analysis—reader interpretation and experience is valid because it’s the words that matter, not what the author wanted to say with those words. we can judge how well the author accomplished what they wanted to say with those words, but we can also consider what those words themselves actually said independently of authorial intent.i highly encourage watching lindsey ellis’s video on death of the author, it goes over this point well.",0

7542,"truth is that asoiaf and malazan are technically not grimdark either. their authors never acknowledged their works as grimdark. but those books were written before the grimdark style became codified. they are considered grimdark because they are the forerunners of grimdark. they were (sort of) grimdark before people knew what grimdark was.nowadays, however, a book is grimdark only if it is specifically written and marketed as grimdark. nobody is ""accidentally grimdark"" anymore.then again, it takes more than a bleak setting to be grimdark. some considers grimdark a ""fantasy protestantism"": characters have to choose between good and evil, and are ""just as lost as we are"". grimdark is about moral choices and their consequences. if your daughter gets kidnapped and you go save her, it's not grimdark. grimdark is when your daughter gets kidnapped but you hate her, so you consider not saving her, but then decide to go save her anyway, and it turns out your daughter pretended to be in danger to lure you out in a trap and kill you.",0

7613,"in terms of darkness i would put it into the same categorie asoiaf is. if you call this grimdark or not is a matter of definition. asoiaf is cathegorized as grimdark because it was at the beginning of the developement to a darker style of fantasy. fifth season and asoiaf both have hope, they both show the character groth is possible and they both have protagonists that a dark and selfish at times too.they do differ in many ways from abercrombies work (especially the ability of characters to chage) and are a worlds apart from scott r. baker in terms of hopelessness.the main thing the fifth season is praised for is the way it incorporates real world themes in its story. so the darkness is not the first thing people see when they look at the fith season.the one thing which is interesting for me is how much the readers are willing to overlook essuns own cruelty and how much it seams to bother her when she kills innocent people. so as a protagonist essun is not completly on the bright side for me.but in terms of genre it is often more important why a book is praised at the first glance. martins big difference compared with other fantasy of his time was the darkness and moral greyness of his characters. jemisen was praised for other things so people don`t put her in the grimdark categorie. i would argue that asoiaf would not seen as grimdark if it would be released today because we have seen much grimmer things in the last years.",0

(ethan is a tough strong man but essen just a bitch, if you know what i mean). people don’t want to read about racism and slavery other than in a quick feel good way, kelsier from mistborn kind of way. (i like sanderson a lot but it was not an emotional look at slavery but a outside savior-heist narrative.) i definitely think that the combination of female writers and female protagonists plays a role in this. there’s a element of deep perspective shift and i feel like some men might not relate.also reddit is kind of a self-perpetuating hive mind.  reddit skews a bit young so the essen/nasun relationship might not hit for younger people.oh, and fifth season isn’t very cinematic. like “name of the wind” and sanderson are incredibly cinematic. every sanderson book is like a spielberg movie (or at least the 15 or so i’ve read).",0

7651,"the second book is even better than the first one, go read it quick!sanderson doesn't write in his own style, but he doesn't try to write in jordan's style either. it would be hard to define jordan's style as it changes over the course of the 11 books he write. imo the first 3 were very well edited with tight pacing, no unnecessary parts. but my guess is as he got more popular, he gained more power and his editor stopped correcting him as much. by the time you get to the 6th book you can see the pacing is starting to ramble and after that there's no end in sight and no direction for the next 5 books.i just had a realization. in sanderson's lectures on writing, he talks about progress, which he considers to be one of the elements required for a good plot. by progress he means that the protagonist has to be working towards a goal, and over time, there is a clear and measurable sense of progress towards that goal. he says it took him a long time to learn of the importance of progress, but he did not say where he learnt it from.i just realized that maybe he learned about it from reading wot? the first 3 books has good pacing and a clear sense of progress. after that it's a bit shaky but still not so bad. we know the final end point, the dark one gets defeated at the last battle. but how close are we to the last battle, and how long is it going to take us to get there? for a while there was a clear sense of progress from counting the number of forsaken that had been defeated. but then after a while you get some books where no forsaken get defeated at all, and there is no sense of progress to the end point.there's a similar flaw in the recent a song of ice and fire books too. that's probably why it was so hard to write a satisfying ending for season 8 of got (because it was nowhere near the ending point and should have gone on for several more seasons to tie everything up)anyways tl;dr: my personal opinion is you should read the first 3 books of wot, pretend it's a trilogy, stop there, and go read something else. wot is a series that is important to me, as it was the first series that made me realized i loved reading. if i could go back in time, this is the advice i would like to give to my younger self.",0

7699,"i've only read the fifth season, but that books is full of people acting altruistically. greed and ambition might be powerful factors shaping the background of the setting, but a huge percentage of the cast spends a huge portion of the on-page time trying to do what they think the right thing to do is, often despite the lack of reward.even outright antagonistic people who are actively engaged in oppressive and horrific systems, sometimes take the time to show people as much kindnesses they can.the narrative soundly rejects the idea ""morality is a naive weakness and hope is a pointless lie"" that saturates and defines grimdark, even if it does portray a world brutal enough that it could easily feature in a grimmdark story.",0
7700,"ever notice that those extra 500 pages are also just the most inane thing? how many feasts does your character have to go to so they can get 1 line of important dialogue that you ""cleverly"" slip in? additionally do you really need to introduce count lothmir of fallouse to say one line of dialogue and add depth to your world, before he disappears because he wasnt really relevant?just how vividly do you have to describe the tender roast pork, topped with sautéed zalafaranian orange slices, their juices running freely down the thick cuts of meat onto the kasparasian olives pitted and sliced thinly, as well as the 14 other courses in every meal of lolafarangian court?",0
7701,"what other types of fantasy media do you enjoy?for example, if you play tabletop games, i'd recommend kings of the wyld - it has a lot of d&dish references and humor.if you like darker and grittier stuff with more antiheroes and villain protagonists, the blade itself is a good pick. i haven't read malice, so i can't give more specific details on that one.",0

7705,"yeah, one of the first things i noticed when sanderson took over is that his sentences felt generally shorter and more concise than jordan's.",0
7706,"i work for one of the stars of the show and they started filming at least a year before covid was even on the horizon. still, i understand your point the release could have been better timed..i have a hard time watching my boss act so i’m probably not watching anyways but this would def put me off too",0

7714,"rangers apprentice has both, which is a plus in my opinion.",0
7715,"yep, you’re right. this is incredibly irresponsible.people are so influenced by media, including fiction. look what happened in 2012, one hollywood disaster movie spawned a whole host of conspiracy theories that ten of thousands of people fell for (spoilers: the word didn’t end in 2012).the potential for harm is so much greater with a global pandemic though. how the hell did this get made, let alone released?",0
7716,"i know the history behind this! authors used to be paid by the word! starting dying out when that changed.also why books used to have lots of semi colons and long sentances, no one would cut a story of fin the middle of a sentence so you could ensure more words made it in.",0
7717,i think the cleric quintet is probably the best works of salvatore.  very deep characters.,0
7718,the worst villain ever invented is father hugh from the crown of stars by kate elliott. you'll love this series if you want someone truly irredeemably in a position of power - abusing that power at every turn and manipulating those around him for his own gain. also the rest of the setting is also pretty raw and brutal.,0
7719,"name of the wind - partick ruthus. hero is still charmed, but tragedies occur in an absolute emotional roller coaster.assassin series - robbin hobb. hero wins, but at the personal cost of almost everything. pillars of the earth - ken follet. not fantasy, but medieval, which might still work. heavily plays to the fact that money and power win out over determination and grit. politicians are corrupt, rather than noble. and life as a medieval peasant generally sucks. and if you are a woman, you don't magically avoid pregnancy centuries before birth control was discovered.",0
7720,"definitely his own style. he mutated the characters down from fully fleshed out entities to bare bones basic superficial personalities... and their individual climaxes left so much to be desired. the last three books should be rewritten, in all honesty. i’m glad someone finished it, but... at what cost?",0

7725,"these two kind of veer into potential homoeroticism though, but whether as true friends or lovers, it's still a very special and epic relationship!",0
7726,to say that this show will influence people to not wear masks and vaccinate is like when people said video games made kids violent. i think humans (even the simpler ones) make decisions based on very complex factors.also i don't know how much room there is in an antivaxxers world for shows like this.,0
7727,"it works, really.  i had similar worries.  !she's a moderate who's capable of being ruthless when she thinks she's in the right (and who is far too trusting of her father) in a world that needs drastic change and less ruthlessness.  it's somewhat understandable, i think, that it takes her time to change, but she does change, in the end.  that her father truly cares for her doesn't help - families are complicated.!<",0
7728,well i don’t want to say anything because i was completely delighted as all the impenetrable mind fucking from the first three quarters of the book resolved into something that made sense and i’d hate to steal any bit of that joy from some body else. but i look forward to the rest tomorrow.,0

7737,"i mean there's rape scenes and there's backstory rape and there's implied rape, and then there's sexual violence scenes, sexual violence backstories, implied sexual violence.  and then there's stuff that isn't portrayed as either but irl if this went down the character would be charged with assault.",0
7738,buy my book,0
7739,"i think it’s a sort of whedonisation of character writing in sf/f. everyone has to be snarky and quipping all the time, same voice, same style, all for the “witty” “banter”. it goes double for female characters.",0

7741,just finished watching the uk version. might be one of the best shows of all time. in fact it's why i give channel 4 a pass on all the crap they make. bbc and itv never would of had the balls to make utopia.,0
7742,thanks for the list op!i was looking forward to read some fantasy books with focus on strategy.,0
7743,sometimes people just fail and die alone. the wolf hall trilogy by hilary mantel is fucking fantastic but there’s no hope for cromwell in the end.,0
7744,there’s a few character povs that are jarringly different. it takes a while to get used to but by the end you cant really tell.,0
7745,"yeah, you can see this in matt’s interaction with female characters. bs had matt flash his best smile because matt knew it would work. rj had matt flash his best smile because he didn’t know what to do.",0

7748,"but people who believe this is going on are going to watch it is the issue. media hasn't been shown to cause anything, but it has been shown to encourage things. pedophiles see child sa portrayed as ok and see it as proof child sa is ok regardless of the fact its fiction. more positively, queer rep encourages queer people to come out.it's something creators ought to consider before writing a a story, are you personally ok with the fact people are going to look at your work and say, ""see? there are other people who believe what i believe!"" there are several topics i can think of stories around that i personally do not feel comfortable writing for this reason. i don't believe any topic should be off limits, it just sucks that we live in a world where bad people can look at something intended as harmless and decide to pervert its message.",0

7765,"the tv show analogy is a good one, but in my opinion both dresden and sandman have already pulled a fonz and jumped the shark.  when i get to the point with a series that it seems to me there is just ceaseless conflict for the sake of conflict, and the baddies become unmemorable and interchangable, i'm out.  urban fantasy seems to fall prey to that sort of repetition.",0

7770,"so, if i know most of the myths and sagas, then it won't make sense to read that one? i had been thinking of giving neil gaiman a shot, and considered to start with this one, but your comment made me reconsider. does he add something new and/or special?",0

7784,sometimes the fan speculation is better than the actual author’s intentions. sometimes you get a burning white situation.,0
7785,i’m kind of two minds about it because it does feel like reporting but sometimes that reporting feels very natural. the black company is technically croaker’s annals recorded from his perspective so it makes sense. other stories use it to really put you in the protagonist’s head in a semi stream of consciousness like the land of milk and honey.,0

7807,"preaching/lecturing.whether it's the narrative voice stopping to deliver the moral du jour, or the characters giving grandstanding speeches, or debates written one-sidedly, it annoys me. the few times i tolerate it tend to be when it's the narrative voice adding it in a la severian from the book of the new sun or hadrian marlowe from the sun eater books, where it's baked into the first person narrative. it's especially bad when it's multiple characters parroting the same thing (malazan has been annoying me with this. i don't object to soldiers philosophizing; i object to fifteen different soldiers all sounding like the exact same philosopher). part of it might be folks trying to put important themes into their works, but those themes work a lot better when handled with subtlety. right now, a lot of stuff feels like it has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.",0
7808,"sanderson admits he wrote in his own style but tried not to deviate too far from the jordan baseline.  there are things he just not pull off, like the very detailed descriptions and the chapter titles.  but all in all, he had a lot of jordan's notes and harriet.  i think it's likely we could not have had better.",0
7809,"i recently started reading web serials. and i do like (some) of them, but their length imo is their biggest weakness. web serials aren't just long, they are unending like the universe. very very very very long, but with only enough plot for a normal-ish epic fantasy. (of course the other problem with them is that most of them are trash.)i will admit part of the problem is i'm reading existing web serials, and so it means i have to catch up. they do get much more bearable if you read them on a release by release basis instead of catching up with years of released chapters. their plot to length density is low, but that isn't as big a deal if you read on a chapter per week basis (or whatever the release schedule is).",0
7810,yup i genuinely do not think i would have noticed if i didn't know going into the books that it wasn't jordan writing them.,0

7814,"chosen ones, magical lineages, and the lack of focus on the political underclass. i am positive these are all related, but i would kill for an author to actually go in on these aspects of the fantasy genre and be like ""so. screw that nonsense. that's not actually how things work."" like, i can take a lot of grimdark and find something to find interesting, but i cannot stand how pervasive the class system seems to be in a lot of fantasy. it's like a crazy blindspot that makes me want to slap the author and the fans. there's criticism in these stories, but it's unlikely any of these series end with ""all your favorite characters die because the nobility are parasites.""also, magical lineages: subvert them more. make it a propaganda thing. something other than leaning full-ass in.also, stop pulling your punches. i promise you, if you're interesting, i will follow you until someone shinier comes by. have a warlord stabbed by servants more. let the victims have their revenge! or become monsters who hurt people! just go hard.",0
7815,that last one is actually just a misconception. historical evidence suggests a large percentage of commoners being able to read and write.,0
7816,"honestly. i just don't, no matter how hard i try i can't. so i stick to shorter series with shorter books. there's lots of great stories that are easier to swallow than super long epics",0
7817,i enjoyed this series and recommend it.  it was interesting in that the characters were defined by their flaws more than their strengths for the most part.  an event halfway through book 1 really sets the tone!,0
7818,i read the dritz series because it was my hubby's turn to pick. i usually like more developed character driven books. with strong female protagonist. who get sh# done . that being said i did enjoy parts of the series dritz character i found was the strongest developed character at least in this part of the forgotten realm series.   i thought dritz was a good character a bit one demential. especially when the hunter aspect comes out.  over all it was a fast passed action driven series we read the first three trilogy's. honestly i wish we had stopped at the end of the second set of books. for me what made the books fun was the relationships dritz built as his journey progressed.     i'm sure my husband and are teenage boys have a different take on the series.  i know this is going to sound sexist. but it's a fantastic series for guys or anyone who prefers action over character development. i know all three of my guys found the books entertaining.,0

7826,the interesting thing about it is that he never looks at a spoon the same way ever again.,0
7827,"that’s fair but i think the difference between works like malazan and aqotwf is where you find the hope. malazan instills hope in the story (and a bunch of random bullshit that feels like filler) and that’s great, there’s no one way to write a story and there shouldn’t be. meanwhile, aqotwf puts empathy in the reader by not shying away from how bad things can be and teasing out the desire to make hope in the real world where it can’t be found in the story. again, that’s just my take and there isn’t and shouldn’t be one way to write hope, loss and darkness.",0

7836,i also enjoyed the series.,0
7837,exactly my point. these books have purpose and the authors show a great understanding of empathy.take malazan books for example. certain characters go through tremendous struggles but somehow empathy and hope still remain the core of the book.,0
7838,no! didn't you hear this random dude from the internet? george orwell is a shitty writer for not providing the reader with hope after 1984's ending.,0
7839,sanderson writes mat as a joker. jordan writes mat as the joke.,0
7840,agree with you on the pace change. frankly i found the sanderson books choppy at times.,0
7841,he clearly didn't mimic jordan. but i would absolutely say writing wot changed sanderson a bit. you can see a marked difference in his writing before and after he started working on wot and stormlight in particular shows it.,0
7842,excellent show. i just finished watching when i started the book lol.,0
7843,"i agree, i loved the series and think maybe people are just way too sensitive.",0
7844,"i think writing off unhappy endings as nihilistic cringe kind of sounds less empathetic than you paint the authors to be. books like all quiet on the western front, of mice and men and 1984 don’t end up happy, quite the opposite. but they don’t just circle jerk over everything being awful but instead instill a sense of empathy in the reader who learns to care for these characters and how the world molded them and their endings. to me, that requires a great understanding of empathy, suffering and why needless suffering is just so horrible .",0
7845,are these actually a ranking or just of way of forming a list. cause if so the biggest problem is putting red knight at the bottom of the list.,0
7846,90% of those books is an army marching.,0
7848,i will admit that while watching a commercial for that earlier i had some of the same thoughts. wondering who was financing this thing.,0
7849,"yeah the timing probably isn’t the best but i it’s just a show. people who are willfully ignorant will stay willfully ignorant. everyone else will probably just watch it to see how it stacks up to the original, not want to watch it because they don’t want to be reminded of the pandemic or just watch it because it’s a new show and there’s nothing else on.",0

7857,i really dislike it when authors describe a scene for ten minutes and have very little character dialogue. i dont need to know the color of the tapestries lol i just want to see interactions of characters. i know that scenes still need to be described but i feel like sometimes it's just way over the top and i just want the story to move forward.,0

7862,"i guess i’ll be the odd man out and say that i found the difference to be very noticeable and i didn’t enjoy sanderson’s additions at all.  he very badly butchered the character of mat, and added extraneous characters that served no purpose and were clearly his own creation (oh look, a warder we’ve never heard of that’s even better than lan).most people seem pretty happy with them, but i really disliked them, to the point i’ve never reread them, and i used to reread the series pretty regularly.",0
7863,"sure. but books do end in hope. that things will change.to quote gaiman, ""fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.""that can be extrapolated to all genres of fantasy.no one is saying that everything ends up being rosy at the end, but if a book ends in all gloom and doom, the author is just a shit author who actually hasn't seen gloom and doom. his privelege and the sheer lack of empathy towards actual human suffering is incredible.",0

7865,"i love the book but even on rereads, i sometimes get lost because she takes so long to really get going. the book really picks up when jonathan shows up but it takes a while. the book is about the return of magic to england, if that helps.",0
7866,"completely agree with this assessment.the first few books were, imo, fantastic.  the middle contained a lot of world and character building. enjoyable to some but not all (though as a lover of the silmarilion i appreciated these).  the final few, including sanderson's contributions, knocked it out of the park for me.",0
7867,"! i do think it’s piranesi. although he is a victim and has to be rescued, the book is about the meaning he makes of his situations. knowing she wrote this book during and/or after dealing with agoraphobia and chronic fatigue leads me to believe his is the experience she is telling. a person doesn’t need to do exciting or epic things to be worth having a story written about them. !<",0

7875,"i think it comes down to whether you're reading to feel strongly or to escape your feelings. sometimes i like grimdark, but my life is enough of a shitshow that reading a good book with a happy ending is something i need to get through everything else. seen lots of my family die over the last couple years, including my mother (was my only remaining parent... i'm only 33 ffs), so i really try to avoid sad endings, to the point i'm willing to spoiler myself to make sure. back when things were still pretty okay, i was definitely more interested in having my heart ripped out through fiction since i wasn't emotionally taxed all the time already.",0
7876,"exploration for sure, the directions they are following are so ancient that nothing is recognisable, they are entering new places, unexplored areas, trying to find their way.politics maybe, amberle is essentially a princess or close enough.  the king is a heavy focus and there is a bit of political annoyances happening there.  even the demons could be said to have political things going on, in a way.i actually think that the ellcrys, the forbidding, and the bloodfire could considered bdo - they have lost so much history and knowledge of these things that only amberle and allanon really understand what needs to be done by the end - and that is only because of their direct communication with the ellcrys.  so everyone else is scrambling to understand the forbidding, the demons, and how the ellcrys works.  i mean they barely even believed in the forbidding anymore before everything happened, so it's a bdo for almost everyone.",0

7887,"because it's not fantasy in the traditional sense. it's better classified as a dystopian sci-fantasy novel. also, i personally think this book is way overrated. the ""magic system"" is more of just a mutation along the lines of x-men except everyone is the mutant avalanche (or kwame from captain planet). the apocalyptic broken earth setting is not revolutionary either - just another dying planet setting (e.g. dark sun). the plot is fragmented and not particularly compelling. the ""big reveals"" are not at all mind-blowing and can be deduced quite easily from just a few chapters in. the themes of racism and revenge are pedestrian. the explicit violence and sexual content seems forced. and the 2nd person point of view is absolutely horrendous to read. i almost dropped this book halfway through, even though i've finished every book i've ever started. why this series won the hugo award 3 years running still confounds me!",0

7894,"grimdark is more about disastrous character choices that lead to bitter outcomes than it is about world setting. post apocalyptic is a grim setting, but doesnt' have to be grimdark. could be pretty upbeat depending on the characters and plot",0
7895,a memory of light was such a clean ending to a series that got lost at times. some of my favorite scenes in all of fantasy are in that book. absolutely worth finishing the series if you've made it to the sanderson books.,0
7896,no just a note on the jarring pace change.  jordan should have started wrapping up threads in book 9.  wot as a whole has pacing problems.  the series is done but the ending does not do it justice in my opinion.,0

7959,"unsustainable levels of violence trying to be real or edgy. there’s a personal level: even fit young people get career-ending injuries pretty easily, trauma lingers, disabilities happen, etc. i’ve read too many novels where someone bounces back from a severe injury like action movie hero are missing the mark on realism and it gets as boring as anything else where the plot works only by authorial fiat. if the series has magic, that can change things but you need to show it working - do common people have access? does it work instantly? do you still wrestle with ptsd? does our army have dozens of healers exhausting themselves keeping the hero of legend soloing the other army?there’s a larger level, too, for organizations or cultures. most fantasy is set in agrarian contexts where food production is labor intensive and unreliable. if you’re writing about a massive modern-scale city, there should be some reference to the never ending stream of barges or carts bringing food in from the huge ring of farms around the city, magical stasis keeping stockpiles from spoiling, the only trees around are in rich people’s gardens and firewood is expensive, etc. if you’re fielding armies with thousands of people, show an organized economy which can support that many people not working. if they commonly get wiped out at high rates, show the political fallout and troubles recruiting soldiers, economic fallout from so many missing workers, etc.  a frontier of hearty settlers hanging on in an unforgiving environment is fun to write but the battles are likely to involve dozens to hundreds of people, not tens of thousands. magic again can change this but it has to fit the world-building - e.g. if mages can wipe out thousands of people effortlessly, explain why the regular soldiers don’t flee as soon as they see one. legions of imperial healers patching up soldiers avoids one set of problems but you need a high magic setting for the scale go work.",0

7997,"is it in every single book? no, of course not. but in my experience (and judging on previous posts about this subject) it's certainly not rare. if you broaden it to sexual violence, it's in even more books. if you broaden that to dubious consent, it gets difficult to name a book without it (and trust me, it's become so normal that some of these moments don't even register. i've have some instances pointed out to me, that i completely missed at first). rape off screen is still rape. i haven't read a massive amount of fantasy books yet and i've come across plenty of pretty disturbing scenes with sexual violence. there's also a ton of sexism in fantasy books that annoys me just as much. this article( is a decent opinion piece describing the sexual violence in sff books phenomenon. if you google rape in fantasy, you'll get a lot of websites/forums discussing it, in case you want to read more.edit: before someone falls over the not a massive amount of fantasy books, i'm roughly around the 65-80 fantasy books in total, which i don't think is that much, considering. but hey, you could also just explain why you think i'm wrong instead of just downvoting an honest contribution.edit 2: oh, on an actual count i suprise myself. it's closer to roughly 170 fantasy books.",0

8000,"i'm not sure worldbuilding is the excuse -- after all science fiction (just to pick one obvious example; though there are tons of others like historical fiction) needs to do ""worldbuilding"" too but you don't really see the same very slow developing plots in every book. for whatever reason, fantasy has really bought into the multiple povs as a storytelling device. and not just multiple povs of the same events but multiple storylines that (you hope) eventually come together. so, in a sense, you're reading three books that are only quasi-related. no wonder if takes a few hundred pages for any of the three or four storylines to go anywhere.this really struck me while reading the heresy within by rob hayes which has three unrelated groups of people who take a good 50% of the book to finally meet up and ""form the party"". don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the book. but after finishing i did look back and kinda feel, ""huh, not that much actually happened for a book that's well over 500 pages"".",0

8176,half a king by joe abercrombie,0
8177,"here are a few of my current favourites: an elegy of heroes: the agartes epilogues by k. s. villoso is an epic fantasy that doesn't focus on the heroes of the super powerful magicians or the royalty. instead it focuses on normal people who get caught up in everything. it's an excellent epic fantasy with rich world-building and great characterizations. there's a mystery relating to some ancient powers and monsters and it spans many different kingdoms and empires, showing us a vast and very realistic world that i fell in love with. chronologically this trilogy takes place before villoso's more famous ongoing trilogy starting with the wolf of oren-yaro. the chronicles of adalmearc by d. e. olesen is an epic fantasy set in a realm that has just lost its high king. this leaves a bit of a power vacuum that causes all kinds of battles and power grabs and political battles between the nobles of the land. it's very descriptive (almost reminiscent of tolkien) and this makes for some excellent sieges and battles because i was able to imagine what was going on and follow the strategies of the battles. and at the heart of the series there are some really strong characterizations of varying characters who are trying to do what they think is best for the realm, but often each character's definition of that is different. currently by sarah mensinga is a steampunk stand-alone novel. it's got some of the best world-building i've come across in this subgenre and the main character's adventure allows us to see a variety of different cities across this world that is ruled by tides. there's also an interesting magic system and some excellent characterizations. and if you like the steampunk genre i would also recommend askaro of the falcon by lady li andre, which has more of a focus on an airship and on one city and is very fast-paced. i'm currently reading between the shade and the shadow by coleman alexander and loving it. it's got a non-human protagonist (a sprite-ling that dwells in the forest) who has some cool powers and lives in a very unique society.",0

8222,"to tell the truth, pretty much all of wildbow's stories fit this request to some degree. except maybe pale, but then again that's only partway through, so give it time.pact( the estranged black sheep of a family unexpectedly becomes his grandmother's sole heir, discovers that magic is real, that his family was into some dark, dark stuff, and that he has inherited a great many enemies along with her estate.the whole story is something of an exercise in how much someone can lose and still remain a person. literally so, in some cases. just about every encounter takes something from the protagonist, win or loss, and the wins tend to be pyrrhic in the best cases.the biggest complaint against this story is that it's unrelenting and brutal in its pacing, but frankly that sounds like what you're looking for, so here i guess it's a plus.worm( a bullied teenager gets super powers and sets out to become a hero, only to become an accidental villain due to circumstances and her own distrust of authority. by and large, her experience with superpowers is one of escalation and conflict, with her wins often coming in the form of short term gains that invite more trouble down the road.almost certainly my favorite take on superheroes, with a great explanation for powers that ties everything together pretty much perfectly. good characters, good worldbuilding, all around great story.",0

8264,"i've read and enjoyed all three, so here's some info to help you choose.malice is probably the most 'traditional'out of the three in terms of feel and storyline. it's got some classic fantasy tropes in there - prophecy, coming of age character learning they have a greater destiny - but does enough with them to not feel predictable. it has plenty of intrigue and action, and i like to think of it as a fast paced game of thrones-lite (which does unfortunately mean a few too many characters and locations are introduced in the first half of the book). of all three, if you are looking for something that best captures wider elements of heroic fantasy, it's your best bet.kings of the wyld is not quite a parody, but it's definitely not the most serious of books. it's fun, filled with magic and monsters and larger than life characters, as well as loads of references to classic rock. if you want to read a book that is more often silly than serious (although it does have its moments) then go for this one.the blade itself is actually somewhat deconstructive of many fantasy tropes (to say which would be a spoiler). it's dark, but often funny, and all the characters are bastards, yet still you somehow root for all of them by the end. the series is definitely more character focused than plot focused, which some people find off-putting, and it can seem slow at times. if you want something morally grey, with a black comedy-esq sense of humour, try this one.but my main piece of advice is to just try something out, and if it isn't working for you by the time you get 25-35% of the way through, try something else. all three books you've listed have very different experiences in store for you, and that's still a tiny subset of different fantasy genres and styles.",0
8265,"the style is not similar, but sanderson generally writes in an ""invisible"" commercial prose style, and honors some of jordan's tics (""she folded her arms beneath her breasts..."") so unless you're extremely focused on prose constructions, you won't notice.if you are extremely focused on prose constructions, it will feel like a lot of what was present in jordan's prose is missing from sanderson's.  their phraseology is not similar.",0
8266,"i would say the broken empire trilogy by mark lawrence. i barley finished the first book because for me it was like reading fanfiction of an edgy 14 year old kid that wrote about himself as the main character that somehow leads a band of cutthroat bandits, kills without a thought and etc. but i got hooked at the end of the first book and starting with the second book with every page the story got better and better. you start to understand jorg, how he came to being this person and you see him grow as a character. by the end of the trilogy i actually really liked the character that i despised in the beginning",0
8267,"that’s especially important for wot and asoiaf because there are so many characters that weave in and out of the narrative and show up books later with little to no introduction.  slowing your reading and reading other series would really interfere with the already difficult task of keeping them together.  all that being said, personally i find that i build ‘momentum’ as i work through a finished series.  each event getting me more excited for the next!  hopefully you’ll experience something similar where you really develop passion for the series you’re reading.also you have so many good books ahead of you.  i’m jealous of you getting to read them for the first time!  enjoy!",0

8318,for something different and fun perhaps try kings of the wyld by nicholas eames. part of a series but reads like a standalone with great friendships.  could work well for your s a palette cleanser. i also just started jade city by fonda lee so i can't vouch for the quality throughout but think gangsters with magic in the 50's isch. so far i'm loving it and that it is very different from other things i've read recently.,0

8507,honestly as someone whos read asoiaf multiple times a game of thrones and a clash of kings are my least favourite of the main series because of how dry they are. a storm of swords is when grrm started livening things up by adding in more humour and action.,0
8508,"thanks, getting it now.enjoy your reads.",0
8510,"the goblin emperor by katherine addison deals with very low stakes: it's a slice of life fantasy about a goblin who unexpectedly becomes emperor and then tries to do as good a job as possible in the rest of the book. i think the most high stakes like thing that happens is an assassination attempt.terry pratchett's discworld novels usually also deal with fairly small stakes, especially the watch series books. its mostly the watch trying to protect their city. the series starts with guards! guards!neil gaiman's neverwhere deals with a man trying to get home after accidentally ending up in a strange world.",0
8511,"his closure of the series is a mixed bag. where he's good, he is very good; but where he misses the mark, he misses it by a country mile.i try to take a balanced view; it's an imperfect end, but i'd rather that than no end at all.",0
8512,"does anyone know of a fantasy or book discord server with an active community? the only one i found is ""book lovers club"" which is nice enough, except for the rule that you can't use voice chat before reaching rank 30 (which means you have to be actively messaging for 40-80h by my rough estimation, which would take me months if not years due to being busy irl). that kinda defeats the purpose for me. i want to talk not message about fantasy books.",0
8513,"it has mil fantasy elements, but most of the time it just follows some pairing while they travel. compare that for example with black company, where the military unit is always in the center of what happens.",0
8514,  possibly this?,0
8515,"interesting. i have more or less the exact opposite opinion of that series. i would do morning star < golden son < red rising, but golden son and red rising are interchangeable. and i would put both iron gold and dark age below golden son, and probably morning star as well. the series was just so dark and depressing the whole time. it really just wore on me. granted, that may have been the point, but the victories seemed meaningless and contrived, and the losses crushing.",0
8516,is it available physically? cause for some reason reading lots of text online really fucks with me.,0
8517,"hard disagree, i also think it's a near-perfect novel.",0
8518,"try the online serial (completed) twig by wildbow. that poor protagonist spends more time half-dead than healthy, same for his allies.",0
8519,"yea, i've read the witcher, obviously great.this new trilogy news intrigues me, and if they say it's better than his (current) top serie.. sounds very cool!and no, i don't read polish lol",0
8520,i too finished it earlier this year and decided i just did not care enough about any of the characters or the world to continue reading any more of the books. it also seemed like a lot of the action took place off screen. i can see why it's so influential but it ain't for me.,0
8521,"indeed, i think that's why the setting has much more established nation states, with quite centralized authorities, compared to a more feudal medieval society",0
8524,"nah, i like it when the good guys win. it is also nice if they're able to save whatever before it gets trashed & a lot of people die.",0
8525,i guess it does.,0

8529,"possibly? i'm about halfway through this book now, and i don't see the similarity, personally. i've read the blade itself through last argument of kings, so i can't speak to his more recent writing, but while they're both relatively low fantasy with a focus on flawed characters, the way that's conveyed to the reader is totally different.",0
8530,"this! i stopped reading the blade itself like 5 times. it was just boring, nothing happened and i just wasn't that interested in the characters yet. i forced myself to finish it, loved the end and the rest of the trilogy really made it worth it. i'm so glad i did!",0
8531,"yes, hoping for more pyrre.",0
8532,i really like it. it focuses on nation building and developing a new country out of two countries at war. the main character is intelligent and doesn’t just use brute force all the time. i also enjoy the word building and characters. but it is true that there are mixed reviews on the series,0
8533,"the broken earth trilogy, that thing that happens a bit before the end of the first book completely took me out of it.",0

8543,"yeah, like i said in my edits, i based all this on western europe. i really want to learn more about that era outside europe; western history classes are so eurocentric.",0
8544,"it's science fantasy, but, red rising fits this for me.  and i think he repeated it so far with the second series. red rising < golden son < morning star iron gold < dark ageand while i think it's debateable, i think you could make an argument that iron gold is better than morning star.  you have to make allowances for a conclusion vs. a new beginning but the scope, complexity, and nuance explodes starting with iron gold and dark age is just...fucking epic.",0

8550,sounds like a great book.,0
8551,"your judgement of the middle ages lays too much with europe. at that time india, china, and the muslim world were all prospering and had huge cities such as xianyang, baghdad, gauda and bijapur. and there were armies such as the mongol tumans, the jing and song chinese armies, and the kwharezmian armies. so it definitely isn''t accurate to medieval europe but it could very well be the medieval period.",0
8552,"robert jordan actually explicitly said that wheel of time is set in a time period that is most close to the 17th century, but without firearms. i always found that very clear in the text, but a lot of people still think it’s a “medieval” fantasy setting.",0

8554,"ok!- so you've read that...! it's pretty good....sapkowski - the author of the witcher books- whom you'll have read as well probably, has a newly translated trilogy out soon- the hussite trilogy, which apparently, is better than the witcher...so here's one you can't have read! unless you read polish.",0
8555,"i’d say joe abercrombie’s first law trilogy fits this well. the blade itself (the first book) is a great intro to some awesome characters; however, not a ton happens plot-wise. then things really pick up with the next couple of books, especially the last argument of kings, and you still get to spend time with the fantastic characters. i also think abercrombie just keeps improving as a writer. the age of madness trilogy is amazing so far!-dylan",0

8592,i think the biggest was the stormlight archives. wok was a slog and while the ending was good it wasn’t worth the horrible repetitive 900 pages before things actually start to happen for really reals. my friend lent me their copy of wor and it was pretty much the same thing and i didn’t have the patience for it.malazan i’m kind of neutral about. there are things i really really loved but those were things that erikson just didn’t want to write about so i’d slog through things i didn’t really care about for the few moments he would develop the things i was interested in before finally deciding what he made and what i felt were good were so far from each other.i also was never really a big fan of king’s writing style or story telling. i can appreciate what he makes and how he’s become such a home name but i only really read his short stories or the stand and the latter i tend to just enjoy as a collection of interconnected stories.,0

8722,"other than the clichéd answer of tolkien's middle-earth books, i'd have to say the only series that comes close for me is ursula k. le guin's earthsea books. gorgeously written, with a talent for profound and moving storytelling and flawed but beautiful characters, particularly ged and tenar. everyone needs to read these stories.honourable mentions to jack vance's dying earth stories, terry pratchett's discworld, philip pullman's his dark materials, robin hobb's realm of the elderlings, joe abercrombie's the first law, patrick rothfuss's kingkiller chronicle and george r.r. martin's a song of ice and fire, and a big soft spot for robert jordan's the wheel of time despite its flaws.",0

8734,they are among the best d&d books. i loved them when i was younger. reread them 20 years later and i still enjoyed them.,0
8735,"honestly, i can't sit down and read a long series or an epic fantasy. when i read a book, i like more standard length novels or even a little longer, but not sanderson length or things like that. it sucks because i want to read these books.i solved this issue with audiobooks. it is easier for me to digest these books in audio form. it's this way for two reasons. 1) i don't have to sit down to read it, i can listen to it when i'm in the car or at work or doing chores, etc. and 2) having a narrator helps me visualize and get lost in the world more. it's like a really long campfire story.thanks to that i can read things like mistborn or the kingkiller chronicles and get through other books that are on my tbr and i wouldn't be able to give a fair chance by not reading analog.it doesn't always work. i couldn't get through dark tower or eye of the world in either form.",0

8746,"i gave up halfway through the second book. it was a great series in many ways, but i could not get over how often the main characters behaved as though they were braindead, in order to create plot problems and heighten tension. does this improve?",0
8747,"yes, this one right here. it’s a perfect fit for what you’re after.you may also like joe abercrombie’s work, specifically the first law trilogy and its companion books in the same universe. (i haven’t -yet- read his more recent work, but i would bet it also fits to a large degree.) the first law trilogy is all about subverting fantasy tropes, so there’s a lot of heroes not obtaining their goals, the ones they do obtain turning out to be not so heroic, and getting really beat up (physically and emotionally) or killed along the way. characters are fallible, they make real sacrifices which sometimes don’t work out, and can be their own worst enemy with tragic consequences.jade city and jade war by fonda lee also fit the bill. it’s set in an asian-inspired island nation that is run by competing mafia clans that can use jade, a stone found only on their island, to gain physical powers. the main characters, part of the ruling family of one of the mafia clans, have the admirable goal of protecting each other and their family and clan’s interests, but each has their own way of handling things and their own special interests. it’s a time of upheaval as the country transitions into the second generation after a successful war of independence with continued political pressure from outside and inside. there’s plenty of ruthlessness (including from the main characters), tragedy (some you and the characters see coming but they can’t stop, some out of the blue) and betrayal to go around. don’t get attached to any of the main characters.",0

8768,i have tried to reread the first trilogy a bunch of times but every time i get to that ending in the second book there is just this mounting sense of dread. i like to stop reading before everything goes to shit and pretend the book ends there when he's mostly happy.with the exception of maybe guy gavriel kay there's just nobody who can make you feel real visceral emotion in the fantasy genre more.,0
8769,"sorry i'm late to class. i was confused about the assignment. i stayed up reading 'the razor's edge'. well, not read it; i watched the movie version with bill murray (not the 1940's version).  i was puzzled that w. somerset maugham was still on his feet, much less getting into self-publishing under 'rob j. hayes'.  the moderators have explained my confusion, as they often do. ha. no problem.   questions for hayes/maughham:       both eska and larry darrell are traumatized by the horrors of war. at it's end he goes to climb mountains; she's thrown down a pit. larry will descend the mountain enlightened. would you say eska shall ascend the pit enlightened?  or do you feel such philosophy is best left to the explication of pure action?      when writing characters whose motivations are chiefly anger, rage & the determination to survive, do you ever feel echoes of those dark emotions? or should the determination to survive even be classed as a dark emotion?   do you think the moderators will let me take the exam as pass/fail?'along the razor's edge' seems one of those books sufficiently professional as to be meaningless to classify as 'self-published'. best classify a book like a protagonist; by their qualities, not their origins.",0

8772,"the broken sword by poul andersonthe children of hurin by j.r.r. tolkien (and if reading in verse seems interesting, also his legend of sigurd and gudrun)loki by robert rode & esad ribic. it's a comicbook, but don't be fooled by the fact it's under marvel comics, way closer to norse mythology in tone and style, than to actual marvel comics.elric by michael moorcockto a lesser extend the bas-lag books by china mieville (especially the first one, perdido street station), and the first law trilogy by joe abercrombie.",0
8773,"lotr isn't really a long series. it's only a trilogy, and even then not a very huge trilogy (by modern standards). generally, with shorter series, you could mix and match different series if you think sticking with the same series for an extended period of time will bore you. personally, i wouldn't do that with long series. wot, for instance, is 14 books. if you go a long period between books, you could end up forgetting some details. my recommendation: read the series together. lotr is not that long and shouldn't be difficult to finish, so go with that first. for wot, it's definitely a much longer commitment due to the length. i would still recommend reading them all, but consider reading something in between if it seems like you're ""burning out"" in the series. but even if you do that, don't go for another series, because that would require a commitment itself. maybe a standalone. stormlight, you don't really have much of a choice. it's an ongoing series that will take years to finish, so you're gonna have to read other stuff in between, anyway.",0

8776,assassin's apprentice is my tbr list now i'm going to have to read it,0
8777,glad you liked it. i can confirm the world opens up a lot after book 1. a lot more exploration of the world.i both love and hate eska. she was incredibly challenging to write at times largely because of how mired she is in her own anxiety and depression. but her growth over the series something i'm very proud of. so yeah... love and hate. :-d,0
8778,cool! could i maybe get it with a scosh less torture porn this time? please and thank you.,0
8779,"i personally prefer to switch from series to series as i please, even if that means it takes me months (or on occasion longer) to finish even a trilogy. if i forced myself to read them all in a row, i'd get bored and frustrated and probably just not read anything. i sometimes forget details doing it this way, but i can't say i've ever gotten confused about what things belonged in which books. other people do it differently, of course. so my advice is just to read in the way that feels natural to you and maximizes your enjoyment, and don't be afraid to experiment to find out what that is.",0
8780,thanks. i think i'll do it that way then! maybe i'll go wot -- mistborn -- stormlight archives -- hobbit -- lotr -- song of ice and fire -- (harry potter?) -- ???,0
8781,yes for sure. it’s incredible.,0

8788,"i personally don't like to read long series all the way through unless i just can't wait for the next book. i will read the first book a series, read two or three shorter books, and then come back to it. sometimes i will hit a groove halfway through where i can't wait for the next book, sometimes my interest will flag over time, but usually mixing it up helps me keep reading momentum.",0

8791,"i’m definitely one for seeing a series through to the end before moving onto the next series (assuming all of the series is out, of course). i find, like you say, otherwise the books all merge into one and i forget which character belongs to which series and what the plot was! so definitely best to finish one and move onto the next in my opinion. i have a list of books as long as my arm that i’m waiting to read, and i’m desperate to move onto books in that list, so i get where you’re coming from. there’s no real solution here that i can think of. if you’re going to read books series by series, then you have to be prepared to wait as long as it takes you to read each series!",0

8798,"it’s like sanderson and jordan in the sense of epic struggle to save the world from darkness with long books, but moves much quicker and has more nuance (and there are only 3 books vs 14 or 10). the central conflict is actually much more about free will vs destiny and the philosophical arguments that come into that - and the “villains” are significantly more fleshed out. plus imo it has one of the best, if the best, endings i’ve run across. it’s weakness are the three “main” characters, but are more than made up for by the other main character and the antagonists.",0

8837,"i haven't heard of the other two, but i do second terry pratchett. discworld is a good series. on that note, i personally would start with mort before reaper man. they are both in the same continuity and you don't need to read them in order, but i found mort to be a better entry into the discworld.",0
8838,"soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horsesif we're talking levied peasants, it'd be spears, or farm tools if anything.  swords were, even among wealthier soldiers, typically a sidearm.  pole weapons were almost always the primary weapon of the melee fighter, because as it turns out, swords aren't very effective against armor unless you go for joints or other exposed areas (hard facepalm every time i see a sword cut through boiled leather, maille, or plate as if it isn't there).  spears are also easier to learn to use, and more effective for formation fighting, because yes, formations were still a thing in the middle ages. a disorganized mob doing whatever is going to get deleted by an even slightly organized mob that's working together.little to no logistical support or organizationi take issue with this because an army larger than a raiding party with no logistical support is not going to get very far outside of its kingdom.  you can only forage so much, and under- or unfed soldiers are not happy soldiers.  wagon trains of supplies (and sometimes buying supplies from locals to restock them) were absolutely essential to the army of any time period, and attacking that instead of the army itself, if pulled off successfully, was more strategic than attacking the army itself.",0
8839,"the realm of the elderlings by robin hobbabout half of this series (three out of five arcs) are told from the pov of fitz farseer from his childhood to his older days, and while fitz himself is a great character (although he suffers a lot) i think what makes the rote great is all the other characters and how real they are and feel. as fitz change so do they, both in how fitz (and therefore you) perceive them but also because they aren't written as secondary characters but as beings of their own with their own dreams and goals. also, the best animal companion ever written. the long price quartet by daniel abrahamanother slow, character driven story, this time following ota machi's life in four books separated by 15 years each. the magic system that is both terrifyingly beautiful and so unique might be what makes this series so good in my eyes, but honestly if you don't mind books with little action this quartet is as close to perfection as you can get. the gentleman bastard by scott lynchlocke lamora might be a thief, a conman, a murderer, but the one thing he is above all is entertaining. you follow him and his friends as they are raised by the charismatic father chains, a false priest of a nameless god, to steal from the rich and use that money to, well, steal more from the rich. the charisma of locke and chains is one of the most interesting aspects of these books, but the dialogues (especially the banter) are top notch and the deeply complex underworld of the vibrant cities they visit are also part of what makes these books great. the riyria revelations by michael j. sullivanfeaturing one of the best duos of fantasy, the positive paladin hadrian blackwater and the resentful rogue royce melburn as they are dragged into a conspiracy that could bring the entire world to its knees. these books are a lot faster pace than everything else i listed prior, but they are a really fun read. an elegantly simple prose that guides you from encounter to encounter as the two unlikely protagonists uncover secrets better left buried that finally culminate into a very well crafted and satisfying ending.",0

8848,tim powers' the anubis gates has a mostly mundane londonian 'cour des miracles' with time travel and less ordinary bad guys pulling strings.claire north's the sudden appearance of hope has the heroine becoming a jewel thief because her superpower is that she's so easily forgotten.gareth hanrahan's the gutter prayer has a thieves' guild in a (dark) fantasy environment. same with fewer overtly fantastical elements in angelika rust's ratpaths.dead of light by chaz brenchley is urban fantasy with a small-town modern day magic mafia family.dead of night by m.r. forbes is urban fantasy with a fun necromancer protagonist involved in various dirty jobs because he needs a lot of money for his illegal cancer treatment.,0
8849,i actually don’t totally disagree with this. one thing i hate about stories is when one character is so obviously manipulative and evil and everyone around them but the protagonist just doesn’t see it. and then that person succeeds all the time with no consequences because everyone constantly has shocked pikachu face when they do something evil. the first series has such a character,0

8852,"the farseer books are awesome. works with multiple viewpoints create tension by cutting away at a cliff hanger to leave you wondering if/how the hero is going to avoid being stabbed. robin hobb makes it intense by driving the knife right into the hero's guts and giving readers an unflinching view of how they deal with the consequences. or don't. the 2 series that start in bingtown do have multiple viewpoints and the last farseer trilogy does feature a 2nd viewpoint with cliffhangers but still have the author's deep characters to carry the story. i really like the world building especially in the 2nd farseer trilogy but there is some retconning to show she didn't intend for the world to become as large as it did. for me it's middle earth, westros, and then the realm of the elderlings.",0

8856,as others have said i think it is because she makes you care. although honestly for me the pain is not a positive. still like the series so far (5 books in) but i’m not quite as high on the books as some people because the books sometimes go out of their way to have bad things happen to the people you care about. i wouldn’t cal it grimdark but there definitely isn’t much happiness either.,0

8885,"yup. it's pretty easy to see immediately when starting the books. the north part of middle earth is a wilderness with no real borders and no kingdoms, and while the king (of arnor) is occasionally mentioned, people have no grasp of what the kingdom is, because they don't always seem to know that it collapsed long ago (the hobbits especially mention the king as if he has just neglected to collect taxes in a while, and not that he was killed and his people scattered).similarly, rivendell, mirkwood, dale, and the lonely mountain are all towns/villages/cities with a small unofficial area of influence. they're not exactly kingdoms and their differences are cultural, not nationalistic.it's only in the south that lothlorien (maybe), mordor, rohan and gondor seem to have proper kingdoms, borders, and national identities.",0

8895,"i‘d say this book was character driven, and i enjoyed reading it. eska is a challenging main character to read and most of the time i was either annoyed by her or wanted to shout at her... so i was definitely emotionally engaged. and josef really would have deserved better. i liked him quite a lot because he was still a decent person, even amidst all the hardship. !i had really hoped that he would somehow follow the others and that they would make up and was quite shocked by his death. poor poor josef...!< i wouldn‘t have minded if the book had been longer and featured more background info on the world and on eska‘s past. her description of how she grew up were the parts of the book that i enjoyed most. and i also felt like we just barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer. i will definitely continue with the series and i hope that the blanks will be filled then. at the same time i am glad that i didn‘t have to spend more time in the pit, because there is only so much hopelessness and hate i can take at a time.edit:oh and i have a question for rob (i hope it is ok if i call you by your first name): what are your feelings towards eska?",0

8941,"counterpoint: we're denigrating the high middle ages somewhat too much, and asoiaf jives pretty fine with 14th ce medieval history. if you read any good book about the 100 years war or war of the roses, you'd see plenty of international influences from lombard banker and flemish wool merchant interests. to say nothing of the catholic church. this was a complex geopolitical era too, and the dynastic struggle of house plantagenet was between the lines dictated by economic concerns more than simple familial vendetta.  people weren't primitive fools in the high middle ages. if anything, europe's economy by 1300 was as if not more complex than anything of the roman era (whose main non-agricultural economy was focused on the east). feels like this thread is lurching to an extreme that resembles renaissance archetypes of medieval primitivism and the myth of the 1000 year long dark ages, rather than anything based on sound history.",0

8952,the massive amount of bodies needed in ag back then was because the tech and seeds sucked. the average farm only fed around 10-15 people on a good year. the average bushels per acre yields were in the single digits. the system wasn't the best organized but there's really very little they could have actually done to free people from ag work. the big jump didn't hit until the 20th century when tractors and improved commercial seeds really took off.,0
8953,"in the end, do you feel it was a character- or plot-driven book?the plot mostly consisted of ""whatever bullshit eska is pulling and the consequences of it"" so yeah, i'm going with character-driven.was it entertaining? was it immersive? was it emotionally engaging?yeah, i enjoyed it. the gloominess and brutality of the pit definitely came through and the hints and clues at future events hooked me on the world and characters quickly and thoroughly. is the desire to strangle eska for being a fool considered an emotion? if so, yes, very emotionally engaging.what did you think of the book's length? if too long, what would you cut? too short, what would you add?it read quickly, for sure, and the pacing kept me coming back for more whenever i set the book down. obviously as a first book in a series there's plenty more story to be told, but i felt it worked well as a intro to the series and felt like it told a complete story in itself as well.would you read another book by this author? why or why not?certainly! he's been on my list of authors to follow since i enjoyed never die last year.i did post a full review a week or so back, but i'll put my more spoilery thoughts here, since i try to trim those out of reviews. it's interesting to me that i enjoyed this one as much as i did, with how irritating eska can be. i'm attributing it to the first-person voice being compelling, as well as the characters around her. i'm still on josef's side, he had a much more reasonable and responsible approach to their situation, and i still think he deserved better (way better, considering !his unfortunate demise!<). however, i think by having eska as the lead and making the decisions she makes, we got a more unique/interesting perspective than we would have had with a story where josef made the decisions and got his way. still, i hate eska a little for how she treated him and for her justifications for it (the whole betrayal narrative she keeps coming back to is tiresome and pretty thin, in my opinion). it's proof of the book's success that i can still get riled up talking about eska several weeks after finishing it, i suppose.if rob is around, i would like to put on record that i did actually get to play trust with a group and did not lose any friends in the process. i think the key to keeping friends is to be less terrible than eska (not a very high bar, that). hilariously, i have a friend who argued that there is no point in ever choosing ""friendship"" on the dice, so i'll be keeping an eye on him for other eska-like qualities in the future. and, since i don't think i've asked you my usual author question: if you could spend a day with one of your characters, who would you choose and why? what would the two of you do?",0

8968,"sorry, should have been more clear. catherine de medici was the effective ruler of france as the mother of successive kings francis ii, charles ix, and henry iii, all her sons who kept dying.  she never succeeded as formal queen regnant the way cersei does in the show, but she had a/the major ruling power via her children.in the books cersei certainly takes power after the death of tywin in her role as mother of the 9-year old tommen. she uses that power to elevate the high sparrow and his militant faith as part of a cynical plan to use them against her enemies, which rebounds spectacularly on her. catherine de medici first became a power when her husband died and her 15-year old son became king (francis ii). when francis ii died, her younger son charles ix became king and she became regent. during this period, france was engaged in a series of religious civil wars between catholic and protestant huguenots. catherine was a catholic, but more interested in political power than faith. still, she is known as having unleashed religious fanaticism in her cause--she is often blamed for the st. bartholomew's day massacre in paris and around france when hundred of huguenots were killed on the same day protestant henry of navarre married the king's sister margaret.(eventually henry of navarre would win the war of the three henrys and become henry iv of france, ending the violence and coming to be known as one of france's greatest leaders).it's not actually clear how responsible catherine was for the violence, but cersei's acts certainly seem to match the public image of catherine.",0

9006,"i see what you mean but i think, if anything, it’s a mixture. some misconceptions: medieval agriculture was generally more advanced than roman agriculture especially for northern europe. items such as the heavy plough were invented in the medieval period. romans did have control of his area but their hearts were in the mediterranean, which has a lot of relatively fertile lands that didn’t need all the work. rome was able to have such large cities because they had so much fertile land in their possession and were able to import grain from them. egypt and sicily fed the empire. constantinople fell off population wise for a lot of reasons but part of it was losing egypt and, much earlier, sicily. they could no longer feed a massive city because they lost their bread baskets not because they lost technology. also, polytheistic religions existed well into the middle ages. the lithuanians didn’t stop practicing their native faith until the 14th century. the norse people not until the 10th. it’s not just a roman thing. career soldiers were absolutely a thing in the middle ages. mercenaries were very common through out the middle ages. i can’t think of many medieval english kings who didn’t utilize them heavily starting with at least henry i. by the end of the period they made up the bulk of many armies. and you had the famous swedish pike men.logistics and supply lines were a thing in the middle ages. very hit or miss, to be sure. but men like richard i and henry v were geniuses at this. it’s definitely true of career diversity (although again this was allowed because they were being fed by regions like egypt and sicily.) but the middle ages weren’t static. there was more career diversity as the time went on. before the recent obsession with a fetishized dark ages aesthetic i’d say most classic fantasy was loosely based on high and late middle ages were things like careers, career soldiers, logistics and supply lines, and other aspects are more likely.",0

9027,"i'd also argue that from a military standpoint at least, the advent of gunpowder changed things drastically in the renaissance from what fantasy settings normally depict.can you expand on this? i assume you don't mean the technology itself, because romans didn't have a lot of the technology that is featured in fantasy (the kinds of armors and arms, stirrups, castles etc.). if you allow that part to be a reskinned roman setting, it would make sense to also allow cannons and muskets to be reskinned to medieval. so what differences do you mean?i think you made a good case for why classic fantasy isn't accurate to medieval europe (which is a really common, uncontroversial take), but you didn't make a good case for why it is roman and not something else. the period people usually compare it to is rennaissance/early modern, like /u/thoth_the_5th_of_tho said.that matches almost every point you made, already has the right aesthetics (plate armor is closer to renaissance, for example), and also gives you extra features like guilds and the absence of slavery.edit: also, i don't think your line is very consistent. why are military ranks a point towards roman armies but noble titles something added on? couldn't it be medieval with added on roman army structure by the same logic? what counts as ""costumes""?",0

9164,"sa is notably different from sanderson's earlier work. mistborn, elantris and warbreaker can all be understood as set-piece fiction revolving around a single basic question. what if the dark lord won? what if ruling demigods suddenly get depowered? warbreaker is a bit more muddled with the premise, but still has a similar dynamic with limited area and different viewpoints. sa is very different. it's a whole world and the author actively tries to obfuscate the premise. you will get there at the end of book 3. meaning the thing is also slow. the main characters do not even meet in the first book. also the world is more alien and full of magic than in the other books. so if you found warbreaker too much, i'm not sure sa is for you.",0
9165,the entire point of the first book is to be a noir-detective in a magical world. think humphrey bogart or something with dangerous women and male chauvinists. it’s supposed to be a bit like that.the author turns the noir-down more and more as the books go on. but it never goes away completely.i’m not sure what you think is hipstery though. i’ve never noted that.,0

9176,"i think you have the right track, in that classic ""medieval"" fantasy is not really representative of the medieval period at all, but i agree with u/hergrim that you also seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the period. i'd highly encourage more study into the area to learn what it's really about! you'll discover that almost all modern portrayals of ""medieval"" life are wildly off, and not really in the way that you think. the only one i've found that i really recommend for authenticity is the video game kingdom come: deliverance. as for where our classic ""medieval"" fantasy tropes come from, there are for sure some similarities with roman times, but most of the trappings themselves tend to come from early modern europe, which was itself heavily influenced by roman art and thinking. from what i can tell, the classic western ""medieval"" fantasy setting emerged from early 1900s writers ideas of what medieval life was like, which was itself influenced by (very inaccurate) victorian historical thinking. then that was all mashed together in a stew of anachronisms and nationalism.",0

9180,"though, didn't the post-roman kingdoms and their successors for the most part lack training and experience as large-scale (1,000+ soldiers) forces, as compared to roman and byzantine armies?in the early empire, large scale training was left to the discretion and direction of the governors appointed by the emperor to his provinces, but ideally an imperial governor should be drilling their forces in large scale maneuvers fairly regularly during their tenure. so there would be plenty of small field armies most having one legion (~4,500) supported by roughly its number again in auxiliaries training together for an army of around 10,000 or two legions with auxiliaries bringing the number up to 20,000 soldiers that would be drilling together if the governor felt like doing it or the emperor came around for inspections ala hadrian.in the late empire, border units were broken up into forces of a 1,000 or less and administrative and logistical tasks left to specialized officials to make it harder for officials to rebel and challenge the emperor. border forces could come together temporarily under higher level commanders or an emperor's personal direction, but they would be unlikely to train in larger groups as that might cast suspicion upon them. the emperors would maintain grand retinues of 10,000+ soldiers who would be trained in large scale maneuvers, allowing the emperors to firstly discourage or defeat usurpers and secondarily to fight off ""barbarian"" adversaries.the byzantines kept the late roman grand retinues based around the person of the remaining roman emperor in constantinople which depending on what estimates you use consisted of between 10,000 soldiers on the low end to 40,000 soldiers on the high end. while the theme system was reasonably intact, most soldiers were themata who would partially sustain themselves by farming (and thus time not training for individual, small-scale, or large-scale combat) and kept in generally smaller units where possible to discourage rebellion.edward i's household maintained perhaps 300 or so people who could serve in war permanently around the person of the king. there were lots of small units in the dozens or hundreds based around aristocrats and royals in the period, but the largest permanent units would probably be the few late medieval mercenary companies that could maintain themselves by traveling off to fight another war when their current one ended or met a truce or just through pillaging and hostage-taking in the lands of their former employers. a few such companies would maintain a thousand or more soldiers under arms continuously which would facilitate large-scale training, but it's only at the tail end of the period that rulers outside of byzantium would start forming standing armies maintained in large units as with the ordonnance companies of france.",0

9274,"you can't avoid it. the last book of the lightbringer is really painful. i think if you read fantasy you accept some religious parallels, pauper goes on to be superpowerful is pretty expected.it's fails for three reasons.1. when it's too obvious, e.g. the guy in the lightbringer who is so clearly judas is painful. 2. despite being a christian allegory, we also have the ""if you worship really really hard then i'll save you."" ow that hurt.3. explicit mentions to things the problem of evil, then an incredibly weak one sided philosophical argument. also if you've read any kierkegaard and knowabout the leap of faith, it literally happens in the book about 3 times..it's difficult to ignore when he's using the same terminology as one would use in the real world.btw i enjoyed all 3 of the night angel trilogy and most of the lightbringer.",0
9275,someone really needs to give the books a new cover. i can see people avoiding them because they are ugly and cheap looking imo.,0
9276,"she is incredibly skilled at characterization. you really feel what the characters feel and get swept up in their stories, like no other author can. the characters are just so real and varied!the world is also beautifully detailed and give you a clear image in your mind of what everything looks like. and there is plenty of underlying political intrigue and other complex story mechanisms that make the books incredible reads.highly recommended!",0
9277,"i didn’t focus on it. as stated, i didn’t even notice at first. but if it’s written into the book, the author wanted you to notice it. i’m not sure what issue you have with that, or what you think you’re explaining to me that i’m not aware of. weeks work isn’t good enough to be polarizing.",0
9278,"i happen to have just finished the book yesterday evening, and... well, let's just say i wouldn't have spontaneously pictured zendaya as alex. but i didn't see euphoria, so maybe there are similarities that i miss. however, i'd also say that you are right to suspect that your view on the character may evolve as you progress in your reading...",0
9279,"the liveship traders is imo the best books she has written, and possible the best fantasy trilogy out there.they are, however, set between the farseer trilogy and the tawny man trilogy, so they're actually best read between the two. but i assume you've already finished the saga of fitz, so just sit back and enjoy the ride!",0
9280,border walls and passport checks. dragons instead of planes. magic as a metal detector. mediaeval af.nation states are extremely modern. an excellent point.,0
9281,"you, my friend, have so incredibly much to look forward to in the real of the elderlings.to put it this way: assassin's apprentice is the worst book in the series (of series), so if you love that one, you'll be mind blown by the rest. make sure to follow up the farseer trilogy with the liveship traders trilogy (starting with ship of magic)! it is set in another part of the world and follows completely different characters, but it is chronologically set before fitz's next adventure in the tawny man trilogy. the liveship traders is also the absolute best trilogy of books i have ever read. enjoy!",0
9282,"public bathhouses. they were still a thing even after the fall of the roman empire. in middle ages people bathed regularly. wolf attacks, especially on women and children. farms were not exactly safe havens from them. there is also the fact that most farmers were serfs, and therefore could not move from their land without approvation from their landlord.",0
9283,"interesting observation about primrose. i had thought it was because of a phrase “primrose path.” from what i understood meant enjoying pleasure but in the end would prove disastrous. which was what primrose did for the girls. also, i loved victorian’s language of flowers, and crabapples basically means a life of happiness as a wife and mother, i think. which crabapple blossoms were being trained to be, i believe? i have always loved name meanings and when i read the book the past month i had noticed how the names were chosen for characters with meaning. i’m doing research on names right now that i finished the book last week.",0
9284,definitely soldiers live.absolutely one of the best endings ive ever seen in a series,0
9285,"honestly, the fact that the roman empire was still around during the middle ages is enough proof for most of your points.also, the idea that roman era social and political systems were less complicated is absolutely laughable. hereditary feudalism is laughably simple compared to what the romans had going on.funnily enough op did miss an important aspect of fantasy not really found in the medieval period (but found during the roman period), open battles. for a variety of reasons, open battles were extremely rare and typically only happened when one party was out maneuvered so much that battle was unavoidable.",0

9287,wow you destroyed him,0
9288,"soft magic is magic where you don't know what it can do nor how it does it. series like lord of the rings, game of thrones, and first law have this. hard magic is magic that's almost like alternate physics. if you do x you will invariably get result y out of it. everything you do with magic can be repeated by doing the same steps you did the first time. all series written by brandon sanderson use this.",0
9289,i second this so long as you’re okay with colonial undertones. they aren’t super overt and as far as i remember there isn’t any actual colonial violence  and the tone is more the result of using a victorian-esque setting,0

9295,it’s an ending people either love or hate.,0
9296,"i don't understand this logic. the reason why 9/10 out of the population was farmers wasn't because of a lack of organization, it was that you need that many people to feed the population. you can organize how much you want, that won't change the levels of food production.you're getting a lot of flack because you present yourself like someone who knows what he's talking about, when you don't. if you had more humility, people would be kinder.",0
9297,thanks man :),0
9298,"i also love that about elliott, she leaves a lot to the imagination and speculation. i also liked how she used the rcc structure and turned it around for the main religion, and the pagan ideas and deities she included.truly talented and sadly little known / underrated writer!",0
9299,"probably the fact that they had guns.that's late middle ages, though. we are talking about 1400. there was trade going to a city, there were people of multiple ethnicities. if you had spices, you had people from asia. if you had sugar, you had people from africa. etc.that's not how it works. you need ships for that kind of trading, and not many merchants could afford that. and that's why in the middle ages the italians, and in particular venetia, had trading empires. from the 8th until the 15th century, the republic of venice had the monopoly on spice trade with the middle east, and along with it the neighboring italian maritime republics and city-states.so no, you won't see the african (berber) or asian (arab), you will see italians.",0
9300,"everything is happening in the same universe, but  the books are about new characters. although the liveships include one character from farseers( you’ll understand whom, while reading) and the last trilogy - characters from liveships and rw. so i recommend to read them in publishing order:)",0
9301,"the religion part is what always gets to me. medieval europe had a really rich religious landscape and i feel like none of that is ever represented in fantasy. if a church parallel even exists, it’s usually written as a corrupt institution obsessed with power and misses all the nuance of the actual medieval catholic church",0
9302,"the broken earth trilogy by n k jemisin. an obvious choise, but so so so great. the world, the prose, the sheer gutpunch of feelings every odd chapter. all three books are 5/5can horror be considered fantasy? i feel like it should, so i would also like to add the ballad of black tom by victor lavalle. a black man's take on lovecraft's the horror of red hook.",0

9306,so what are the second and fourth about? or am i asking for a rafo,0
9307,"lots and lots of things. i divide it into two types- when authors doesn't know that things used to be fundamentally different and  when they do know but use wrong point of reference.first type:lack of privacy. most of characters have bedrooms or at least beds. meanwhile in middle ages life used to be a group matters, even for the richest. bedrooms in better houses were public space to conduct meetings and socialise and when night come people who did have beds  slept in them with servants and family. same for bathing, eating and everything else, especially when resources were involved.cost of material things- from spoons to furniture, everything produced by artisans was more expensive and used till it felt off. people used to cont everything including needles in their wills. on the other hand people aspired to live comfortably and look as good as they could afford.light- candles are not lightbulbs. sources of light vary in quality and it was a significant expense even for the richest.horse litters- they are rarely seen but they were main way of transportation for women, elderly and infirm. travelling on horseback was trying, and wheeled vehicles were a pain due to poor roads and lack of amortisation. they know that things were diffrent but fail to gasp howother forms of transferring power than absolute primogenure- elections were a thing. some kingdoms went back and forth between them and inheritance and even then kings tended to name and groom their heirs to avoid power struggle after their death. politically savvy princesses- either wallflowers or resentful tomboys. in real life wife of the leader wielded various amount of power and had means to extend it- by forming own court and diplomacy, money (in poland they were given own domains to govern and support themselves) or religion. religion - it was a part of real life to extent modern anglo saxon writers usually fail to understand but was present. how it was understood was a diffrent matter.related it the above- complicated laws with flexibility when it come to problems. polish kingdom after century of fragmentation was united by king from so minor line that we didn't record his birth. the. there was almost half of the century when people weren't sure if the throne is to be elective or inherited and in the latter case- if they should support  young princelings or their older sister who thought her mother had some diluted blood of previous dynasty.imho it comes from hindsight that presents us our version of the past as inevible while for people living there it was living and fluid as present day",0
9308,"oh, sure.  i totally share your disappointment in that specific aspect of it. i so deeply love that character. she's such a perfect lead for a series like this, and yeah, though she's important in the second book, it's not as centralized on her as the first book was, that's a really good point.",0

9391,"well one thing that's wrong is that the roman empire didn't have better agricultural technology.  the reason it could have bigger cities is because it had better trade networks.   even then its inferior agriculture was bad enough to cause a demographic decline in in the western half that was only reverse after the fall of the western roman empire and the introduction of more sophisticated crop rotation and better draft animal harnesses.  not, mind you that these issues tend to be the meat of fantasy fiction.  it is true that the polytheistic pantheons of typical epic fantasy settings tend to be classically inspired.  on the other hand the metallurgy and architecture are frequently post-medieval.",0

9539,"poor agricultural technology leads to low urbanization (in 1100 constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people) and career diversity (only 1 in 10 people weren't farmers)1) medieval agriculture was every bit as advanced as roman agriculture and, especially from the 14th century onwards, considerably more so thanks to the widespread adoption of the three field system of crop rotation^1. increased use of fertiliser and marling in areas with him population densities, as well as irrigation canals in parts of italy and the low countries, also produced crop yields that were significantly higher than roman era agriculture outside of egypt (8-9:1 vs 4:1).2) urbanisation refers to the number of people who live in towns, not the size of mega-cities, and the middle ages stack up pretty well with the roman empire in this regard, at least within the bounds of that field of witcraft known as historical demography. roman italy, excluding rome, probably had an urbanisation of 7-18%, depending on which population count you believe, although this might have been lower (3-8%, excluding rome) if the rural population was higher( than traditional estimates allow. england, in 1086, had 10% of its population in towns and, by the early fourteenth, 15-20% of its population was urban. italy has similar trends in urban densities, although 20-25% are likely to have been urban around 1300. while if you include rome roman italy may have had a rate of urbanisation as high as 30% (18% for the population high count), rome was an unusual case and not representative of the rest of the empire.3) as with all pre-modern agricultural societies, career density was low in rome as with medieval europe, perhaps even lower when you consider the slaves.small army sizes (usually ~10,000 max) and no standing armyleaving aside bernard and david bachrach's arguments for the early middle ages, armies in the high middle ages certainly exceeded 10 000 men with a high degree of frequency, as did armies in the late middle ages, some of which exceeded 30 000 men in size. since often the majority of these men were men-at-arms, with three or four horses each, the logistical impact was greater than a mostly infantry army of 60 000 men, making their use in the field an impressive feat of logistics.soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horsesplease no, not the ""levied peasants"" bullshit. infantry in the high and late middle ages were made up of prosperous free farmers or townsmen, who were ""levied"" in the same sense that republican roman infantry and medieval knights were levied. also, they fight primarily with polearms and missile weapons, not swords.bizarre and confusing chains of command (one of the reasons the french lost at agincourt was because the nobles couldn't decide who was in charge) with no soldier rankssure, use agincourt, where the problem was that the french army was made up of two factions who were at war with each other every other day and where there were plenty of ranks (marshall, master of the crossbowmen, etc) and ignore the vintenars and centenars of england, the vouden and vingtaines of the low countries, the venticinquina and companies of northern italy, or the conroi used to organise knights, as well as all the many other battles where a clear chain of command existed (including, ironically, the english at agincourt).little to no logistical support or organizationaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhread it.( it!( it!( advanced agricultural technology allows higher urbanization (at its height, rome had between 50-90 million people) and career diversity (4 non-farmers out of 10 people)1) the low count has 38.5 million people in europe - excluding everything east of greece, which is a fair chunk of roman population - in 1000 ad and 73 million in 1346. this means the medieval world had, in 1000 ad, at least as many people as the roman lowcount and in the 14th century probably equaled the roman highcount. unless you mean the city of rome had 50-90 million people, in which case you're incredibly badly mistaken.2) urbanism doesn't work that way. massive standing armies (the british isles alone had over 50,000 soldiers in 135 ad)which were spread out and field armies rarely exceeded those of medieval armies (10-20 000).career soldiers that build their entire professional lives around warmedieval knights and mercenaries: am i a joke to you?highly standardized units and formations; military manuals discussing tactics and other aspects of warvegetius (and all his many medieval reworkers), maurice, the syrianus magister, leo vi, nikephoros ii phokas, nikephoros ouranos and theodore palaiologos: are we jokes to you?clear chain of command with ranks and officersmy god, imagine how unclear the following chain of command is. kingmarshal/master of crossbowmenbannerets/constablesknights/vintenars. truly, it is an incredibly complicated and unclear chain of command.developed logistics with supply lines and corps of engineers, medical personnel, and other specialistswhich is why edward iii was always running into logistical problems, couldn't bridge rivers with ease, why knights didn't know how to treat a haemothorax. /smost ""medieval"" fantasy is early modern, anyway, so why bother with rome instead of the late 15th/early 16th century?^1 there was fairly slow adoption of this system, in spite of earlier scholarship seeing it as a rapid and revolutionary process, but by the fourteenth century it was more common than not. the romans and greeks also understood to some extent the use of legumes in crop rotation and used them as green fertilizer, but it was not the proper 3 field system, nor was it as common.",0

9622,"(in 1100 constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people)minor point, that was in europe - the biggest cities at the time were baghdad at around 500,000 and chang'an which was around 1,000,000.  also the byzantine empire literally was roman, although by that time period it was in severe decline.  the other thing is that the massive armies of rome were a deliberate strategy to move the ones likely to revolt into other places.  so the 50k or so in britain were mostly auxiliaries from spain and germany, while british auxiliaries served in spain and africa.  that sort of strategy evolves from the need to manage a large empire, which is why it also crops up in the empires of the middle east and china.  it doesn't work for small kingdoms, where the displaced forces can easily travel home if they want to.  however the biggest problem with the standard fantasy setting is that most readers have no idea what ""medieval"" actually means, with film and books mashing together concepts that are hundreds of years apart.  compare and contrast for example at kate elliott's crown of swords series, which is firmly based on 800s early medieval with the spread of christianity and viking raids, and grrm's game of thrones, which draws from the 1400s wars of the roses and the succession to tudor rule.  those are wildly different settings.",0

9673,"i find the chose one vs the devil narrative incredibly boring. i find rand to be tedious, and not so much a character as a set of powers. so anything that diminishes him as the focal point of the narrative is welcome. the thing in the series i find most interesting is the aes sedai power struggle and white tower politics.my sense is that, for most readers of this series, the opposite is true. they're bored by the white tower stuff, and want to get back to the main storyline.also the romance storylines of those earlier books were.... rough. but the romance plot undergoes a major shift after book six (or maybe it was book five?) that made it a lot more tolerable for me.  or, actually, maybe not just tolerable, but _good._",0

9722,"also, i'd argue that warhammer fantasy in particular wins by playing into tropes.  like, one of the big draws is that you can play as your favorite  fantasy trope.  it makes it easier to get started.  you don't have to learn about a completely new and unique setting -- instead, you can choose between medieval humans, 1600s humans, dwarves, a few variants of elves, orcs, beastmen, norse raiders, chaos warriors, and so on.  for the most part, anyone can hear a 5 second description of a faction and have a good idea of what they are about, which makes it easier for a new player to decide what to play.  if you want to mix things up more with your setting, i think you probably need to hide some of that complexity from new players.  so, like, mass effect's setting doesn't rely on a bunch of existing tropes, but that doesn't matter that much, because the game starts you off with humans and you can learn about the rest of the setting as the game goes on.  making a new player decide whether they wanted to play as turians, asari, quarians, salarians, or krogans right at the start of the game would be much more intimidating.",0
